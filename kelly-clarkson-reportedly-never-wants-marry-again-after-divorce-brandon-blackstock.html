Not only is her television career continuing to thrive, but the singer has gotten fans talking with her very clear body transformation, <a href=#>which Kelly has attributed to a variety of lifestyle changes</a>.</p><p>While the American Idol winner seems to be doing better than ever, don’t expect Kelly to settle down anytime soon. According to a new report, the mom-of-two isn’t looking for a serious relationship and may even be closed off to marriage given the roller coaster of emotions she went through with her ex.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_kelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-working-at-a-pizza-place-pre-fame_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson's Net Worth Has Come A Long Way Since Her Surprising Pre-Fame Job">Kelly Clarkson's Net Worth Has Come A Long Way Since Her Surprising Pre-Fame Job</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kelly Clarkson worked up to four jobs at a time to make ends meet.

Magazine reports</a>. "She doesn't yearn for a life partner and has even said she had never been sexually attracted to anyone before Brandon."</p><p>Last March, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a different source said something similar to OK!</a> And even insisted that Kelly doesn’t see herself walking down the aisle again.</p><p>“Kelly has joked about the fact that she’s going to be single forever, but at the same time, she realizes forever is a long time,” they explained. “Although she truly doesn’t see herself dating or getting married again, her friends have encouraged her to at least be open to the idea of putting herself out there.

Nothing comes before them.”</p><p>It's been two years since Kelly finalized her divorce from Brandon Blackstock, which resulted in her having to give him a million-dollar payout in addition to alimony and child support, though she has primary custody of their two kids. Their divorce was dragged out for years, even though Kelly initially filed in 2020, as the exes couldn’t reach a settlement despite having signed a prenup.</p><h2 id=kelly-admitted-last-year-she-hasn-rsquo-t-started-dating-again>Kelly Admitted Last Year She Hasn’t Started Dating Again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kelly-clarkson-on-the-kelly-clarkson-show.jpg><p>The report echoes a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sentiment that Kelly herself shared last year</a>, when the television host admitted she’s not ready to start dating and it hasn’t even been something on her mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I haven't even thought about it.

"And I am a little hesitant, because stepparent situations aren't always great for everyone, or even having another person involved." Kelly has previously expressed that the divorce took a toll on her son and daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on, "It's already confusing enough sometimes, like your parents living in different places, and divorce can be hard on kids.
