But it’s not only her social following that she’s hurt – Kylie’s profits are likely to suffer, too.
According to the Daily Mail, Kylie lost a million followers in the last week of February, going from 380 million to 379 million. Conversely, Selena Gomez’s following increased by nearly 10 million, now sitting at 389 million followers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it’s not only her social following that she’s hurt – Kylie’s profits are likely to suffer, too.</p><p><a href=#>According to the Daily Mail</a>, Kylie lost a million followers in the last week of February, going from 380 million to 379 million. Conversely, Selena Gomez’s following increased by nearly 10 million, now sitting at 389 million followers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mohamed Hadid To Pay Neighbours $2.6 Million Over Mega-Mansion Controversy</a></span></p><p>Kylie’s lost following appears to be a direct result of a TikTok she made with Hailey Bieber. Selena had recently revealed she laminated her eyebrows too much by mistake. Kylie and Hailey’s TikTok appeared to be making fun of Selena, by putting an image of the brow next to the text, “this was an accident???"</p><p>Kylie replied directly in the comments after she and Hailey were accused of throwing shade at Selena. "<a href=#>this is reaching. no shade towards selena</a> ever and I didn't see her eyebrow posts!” Kylie wrote. “u guys are making something out of nothing. this is silly."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena then responded to Kylie’s comments, also asking the public to calm down. "Agreed @kyliejenner It's all unnecessary. I'm a fan of Kylie!" the singer wrote.</p><p>However, the damage appeared to be done, as Kylie’s social media following dwindled in the aftermath.</p><p>It’s not only that the drama has an effect on Kylie’s reputation – it also directly impacts her income. She may have multiple businesses to her name, but much of Kylie’s fortune is linked to her social media fame.</p><p>Having a large platform allows Kylie to plug products from her lines, including Kylie Skin and Kylie Cosmetics, while also growing her identity as a brand as well as her family’s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, the near-billionaire can make a large pay check from a single post. One report estimates that she <a href=#>makes between $675,000 to $1 million</a> for a single post on Instagram.</p><p>One person who isn’t suffering amid the drama is Selena, whose brand will likely only benefit from the publicity and new followers. The former Disney star announced her own makeup company, Rare Beauty, in 2020 to acclaim.</p><p>In 2021, <a href=#>Rare Beauty reportedly made $60 million in sales</a>, which is considered especially impressive since the products are reasonably priced. The profits were likely higher in 2022, and likewise stand to increase this year in the wake of the positive publicity for Selena.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West To Release Documentary Exclusively Filmed On iPhone</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=#>LAD Bible</a>, <a href=#>Parade</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4urjInmSjnZ6jsrN5y6iqrWWdnrmttc6nqmanlmKzsLjLqK6eqqNisbC4y5qprGWRoraledKeo56mkWK0sLnEs2SfnaWZfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
