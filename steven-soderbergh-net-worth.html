He has also directed movies like “Sex, Lies and Videotape”, and the “Girlfriend Experience”. He recently directed movies like Contagion, Haywire, and Magic Mike. Steven got his much-needed break when he directed the Grammy-nominated concert video 9012Live for Yes, a rock band in 1985. He has also worked as a game show scorer and the cue card holder to meet his ends. But that’s not all. Soderbergh has worked as a freelance film editor, too.</p><p>His movie “Sex, Lies, and Videotape”, which he wrote in eight days, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It became a huge worldwide success. He was actually the youngest director to win the festival’s top award. Steven directed some low-budget movies too later in his career, which turned out to be a disaster at the box-office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steven Soderbergh was born in Atlanta. He is the son of Mary Ann and Peter Andrew Soderberg who was a university administrator. He discovered filmmaking when his family shifted to Stockholm.</p><p>Steven is married to the writer Jules Asner. He credits her for influencing the female characters in his movies. Steven has a daughter from her first wife Betsy Brantley. However, the marriage didn’t last as the couple divorced in 1994. Later on, Steven married Jules Asner – he has a daughter from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom
