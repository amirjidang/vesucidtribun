With that being said, its characters won't come to life without these incredible actors and performers. Some of them gained recognition from their roles in the series, while other was already massive name before joining the family. To sum it up, we're ranking Money Heist actors based on their approximative net worth, and here are the top eight most valuable ones.</p><h2 id=paco-tous-600k><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paco Tous: $600k</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paco Tous played an integral part in Money Heist as Moscow, a former miner who subsequently serves as Denver's moral compass throughout the first two seasons. Before joining the family, Tous led Antena 3's Los hombres de Paco as one of the clumsy but good-hearted police agents from 2005 until 2010 and reprised the role in 2021. He currently lives with his two children, a boy & a girl, and enjoys moderate stardom on social media with over 1.4 million followers on Instagram.</p><h2 id=miguel-herr-aacute-n-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Miguel Herrán: $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young, reckless, and explosive. Miguel Herrán's character, Rio, serves as the life of Money Heist as the five-part series is told from Tokyo's perspective, his on-screen love interest. Following the success of the series, Herrán landed the lead role on Netflix's original Spanish thriller drama Elite as Christian Expósito, a comic character, in the first two seasons. He's currently gearing up for an upcoming prison flick Modelo 777, which will be released theatrically in the country in September this year.</p><h2 id=jaime-lorente-1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jaime Lorente: $1 Million</span></h2><p>Another heartthrob in the making, 30-year-old Jaime Lorente rose to fame for playing Denver, Moscow's son who knows nothing but the life of crime that he decides to join his father in the dangerous heist. In real life, however, Lorente is a graduate of the Superior School of Dramatic Art in Murcia, Spain, and released a book of his poem collections titled A propósito de tu boca. He's currently gearing up for an upcoming psycho-thriller titled Tin&Tina, which bears inspiration from a 2013 short film of the same name, and will star alongside No matarás actress Milena Smit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Are The Longest Lasting Netflix Original Series?</a></span></p><h2 id=alba-flores-1-5-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alba Flores: $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Alba Flores plays an integral part in the series as Nairobi, but many fans didn't know that her character did not even exist in the original script. Money Heist creator Alex Pina, whom she had linked up with back in 2015 for the limited series Locked Up, called her up after realizing that it lacks female characters.</p><p>"They were writing the script for La Casa de Papel, and they realized that there was just one female character, Tokyo. And they thought,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 'This is not going to work</a>,'" she recalled during an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=itziar-itu-ntilde-o-1-5-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Itziar Ituño: $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>In Ituño's own words, her character, inspector Raquel Murillo, is a "strong and powerful woman in a world of men." Before that, she played quite a similar character in the long-running soap opera Goenkale, which was told in her native Basque language. She played the role from 2001 until its cancellation in 2015. Now, as her popularity boomed, she's gearing up for her English language debut: an upcoming stop-motion animated short titled Salvation Has No Name.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Are The 10 Most Watched Movies On Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=uacute-rsula-corber-oacute-3-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Úrsula Corberó: $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Money Heist is narrated from Úrsula Corberó's character's viewpoint, so it only makes sense if the actress's popularity skyrockets to an all-time high. While fans had polarized views on Tokyo's hypersexualization in the third season, she's still the definition of a strong female lead. After Money Heist, Corberó is eyeing Hollywood as her next stop as she made her US debut in the superhero film Snake Eyes in 2021.</p><h2 id=aacute-lvaro-morte-4-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Álvaro Morte: $4 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before leading the pack of dangerous robbers as the charismatic yet shy antihero, Álvaro Morte was a part of the long-running telenovela Puente Viejo since 2014. After Money Heist, his career took off as he secured his first-ever leading role in a feature film, Mirage, in 2018. Since then, he doesn't seem to show any sign of slowing down and regains his momentum as Juan Elcano in Amazon Prime's historical drama Sin límites.</p><h2 id=pedro-alonso-5-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Pedro Alonso: $5 Million</span></h2><p>Pedro Alonso deserves all the flowers for his chilling performance as disturbing yet oddly fan favorite Berlin in the series, and rightfully so. The actor himself has been around since at least the 90s, but Berlin was the one that put him on the map. Now, an upcoming spin-off based on that character is 'starting to take shape,' and we'll likely see our favorite anti-hero back on our screen in 2023. ​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXquu82esGaglZ7AtXnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0WafmqtdqbWmeceinqGdo6l6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
