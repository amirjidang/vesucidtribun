She even made her theatrical debut alongside Judi Dench. From there, she became a household name. Regarding her fortune, thanks to her appearance in high-grossing films such as The Devil Wears Prada, A Quiet Place, and Edge of Tomorrow, Blunt has accumulated an approximate net worth of $80 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The British actress took up acting to get over a childhood stutter</a>. When she was a child, the star auditioned for a play despite her nerves on a teacher's recommendation. Blunt told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, "I spoke fluently for the first time in a long time, doing a stupid Northern accent that helped me. To get through a whole play and not trip up once â€” I think it was probably more emotional for my mom, who watched. I think that was huge." Nowadays, Blunt is a well-known and established actress in Hollywood. Let's take a look at her impressively varied filmography to highlight her very best work and what movies built her insane net worth.</p><h2 id=edge-of-tomorrow><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Edge of Tomorrow</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to a wildly inventive premise, this sci-fi flick appealed to genre enthusiasts and the general public. Blunt provides one of the film's best parts playing Sergeant Rita Vrataski, the hero everyone needs (or at least that Tom Cruise needs). Helping to show Tom Cruise's character how to fight, Rita is a true force to be reckoned with in exhaustively putting everyone else through their paces, keep up, or pay the consequences. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, the film made $137 million on a $30 million budget.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Emily Blunt's Co-Star Was Told To Drop 35-Pounds So He Could "Keep Up With Her"</a></span></p><h2 id=the-adjustment-bureau><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Adjustment Bureau</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After meeting US Senate contender David Norris on a chance encounter plunks, Elise is thrown into a world of weirdness because the problem is these two are not supposed to be together according to the very ominous sounding plan. Amidst all the chaos and sinister plotting, it might have been easy for these main characters' actual lives and personalities to feel drowned out. Elise's determination to lead an everyday life (which unfortunately is easier said than done) becomes a touching performance. The film made $128 million on a $50 million budget.</p><h2 id=looper><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Looper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proving once and for all that this actress can tackle just about anything Hollywood writers can come up with, in Looper, Blunt plays a gun-totting single mom who's hell-bent on protecting her son at all costs. Against the backdrop of a time-twisting narrative, she comes into her own during the second half of this edge-of-your-seat movie as the so-called "loopers" attempt to infringe on her home. Emily Blunt's character, Sara, makes them known that they're not welcome. The film made $177 million on a $30 million budget. Since Blunt starred in it, her salary must have been pretty high.</p><h2 id=the-young-victoria><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Young Victoria</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From sci-fi shoots to period drama at the palace, Blunt takes the throne as Queen Victoria. The actress experienced the early and more turbulent years of her reign. Ditching her often heard American accent and firmly planting herself on British soil, Blunt paints a colorful picture of the monarch while also showing the delicate yet passionate relationship she shared with her husband. The regal role earned the actress several Award nominations, and the high praise was highly deserved. Unfortunately, the film was underperformed at the box office, making just $29 million on a $35 million budget. Nevertheless, The Young Victoria received numerous awards, which was beneficial for the actress's career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Stanley Tucci's Marriage To Emily Blunt's Sister, Felicity</a></span></p><h2 id=the-girl-on-the-train><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Girl on the Train</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, The Girl on the Train follows the story of Rachel Watson as she journeys to and from work every day. Played by Blunt, Rachel becomes fascinated with an incident she claims to witness in their troubles. However, viewers are soon forced to question her version of events severely. As an incredibly unreliable narrator and complex character, Blunt's performance keeps the audience captivated until the end. The psychological thriller made $173 million on a $45 million budget.</p><h2 id=the-devil-wears-prada><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Devil Wears Prada</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>This film gained massive mainstream attention with Meryl Streep's betrayal</a> of a hand-nosed fashion boss taking center stage for a movie that earned nearly ten times its budget at the box office. According to Parade, "the film was a smash, raking in $327 million on a $35 million budget." Blunt's role is equally eyebrow-raising as she plays a character that viewers don't immediately love. Playing one of Miranda Priestly's passive-aggressive assistances, Emily Charlton, Blunt makes life difficult for Anne Hathaway on a daily basis. Blunt's paycheck for this film is in the mid-to-high six figures.</p><h2 id=a-quiet-place><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Quiet Place</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring opposite John Krasinski, her real-life husband, A Quiet Place places Blunt thrown into an apocalyptic world where even the slightest sound really could get you killed. But Emily's character, Evelyn Abbott, refuses to give up hope as she strives to keep her family safe. Add a constantly crying newborn baby into the equation, and the odds are as slim as Emily's performance is sensational. It's a nail-biting piece thanks primarily to Blunt's brilliance in the high-tension moments. The movie was a massive success, grossing $350 million on a $17 million budget. <a href=#>The actress returned for A Quiet Place Part II</a>, which has grossed almost $300 million worldwide. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blunt was reportedly paid $13 million</a>. There's no doubt this movie built Emily Blunt's insane net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Emily Blunt & Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's Unlikely Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqGcrnqjuNSnq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mamBnf265zq%2BgnqtdqK6trdGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
