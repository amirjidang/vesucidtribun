As if being cuffed by the FBI wasn't enough, Jen Shah has been finding herself in the hot seat all season long, especially when it comes to her ongoing feud with Meredith Marks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jen Shah has us all glued to our screens, it is <a href=#>RHOSLC's newbie, Jennie Nguyen</a> that has viewers reaching for the tissues! The mom of three opened up during tonight's episode regarding her past struggles with pregnancy, a topic that Jennie knows far too much about, considering all she's been through.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Really Happened Between Whitney Rose And Lisa Barlow</a></span></p><p>Although Jennie has made it clear she no longer wants any more children, it appears as if her hubby, Duy Tran, is pushing for one more! The duo are not seeing eye to eye when it comes to the baby situation, and fans are now getting upset with Duy for taking things too far.</p><h2 id=duy-wants-more-kids-but-jennie-doesn-39-t>Duy Wants More Kids, But Jennie Doesn't</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things got tense between Jennie Nguyen and her husband, Duy during tonight's episode, and it all had to do with baby talk! Earlier this season, Jennie revealed that Duy has always wanted a big family, considering his upbringing. Well, you'd think having three kids would be enough, however, the chiropractor is insisting on expanding the family yet again!</p><p>Jennie is firm on not wanting any more kids, mainly due to her struggles with fertility in the past, however, Duy is so adamant that he went as far as suggesting a surrogate or a sister wife! "You think we're able to raise another infant? Running around, diapers? You think I want to do that?" Jennie asked Duy. Jennie made it clear she didn't, leading Duy to recommend a sister wife, a suggestion Jennie didn't take too well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duy explained that his grandfather had 4 wives, and such a practice is by no means foreign when it comes to their culture. Jennie was flabbergasted over the remark, walking off and claiming that she's "pissed," and rightfully so!</p><h2 id=jennie-opens-up-about-past-miscarriages>Jennie Opens Up About Past Miscarriages</h2><p>Jennie has opened up more and more about her reasoning why she doesn't want more kids, and it all has to do with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">torment and trauma she endured</a> many times over. The RHOSLC star opened up to Meredith and Lisa, saying that she doesn't feel as if she'd be able to even handle having more kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had a lot of miscarriages," Jennie told the ladies. "It's hard, it's emotionally draining, I had 13 pregnancies and I ended up with 3 living kids and 1 stillbirth. My daughter passed away when she was 42 weeks," she revealed. Jennie went on to discuss the traumatic event, claiming she was sedated for an emergency C-section due to the baby's heart rate being low. Despite the doctor's efforts, the baby didn't make it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is 'RHOSLC' Star Jennie Nguyen Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-think-duy-is-putting-too-much-pressure-on-jennie>Fans Think Duy Is Putting Too Much Pressure On Jennie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans recognize Jennie and Duy's loss, it appears as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they aren't too happy with Duy</a> putting an immense amount of pressure on Jennie to have more kids. Considering the amount of stress that Jennie's body has gone through, it's no surprise that she's done having kids, however, Duy's persistence is now rubbing viewers the wrong way.</p><p>"Duy is acting terribly...Jennie obviously has dealt with miscarriages, has trauma from that, she’s also older now and for him to pressure her into doing it as though she is obligated to just pop out kids is just not right," one fan tweeted out. To add to the pressure, Duy, who is a doctor in his own right, should understand the ramifications behind risking another pregnancy, only adding more fuel to the fire.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'RHOSLC': Here's Why Fans Are Tired Of Brooks Marks</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaejobBussCnqmaZopp6trzSnqtmr5mptW62xKelop2jYrW2v8GapZ1llKrGbrTEq5ysZaedxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
