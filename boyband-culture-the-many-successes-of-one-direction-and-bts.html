The two all-male bands can be compared based on their success in music, tours, and pop culture influence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is only a three-year gap between the formation of the two biggest boy bands in the world. Simon Cowell created one Direction in 2010 on the show X-Factor UK where he teamed Niall Horan, <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlison, and Liam Payne together. In 2013, BTS was formed when seven members Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, V, RM, and Jungkook, teamed to introduce K-Pop to everyone around the globe. These bands have achieved astronomical success and popularity, unlike any other group. Their charm, charisma, and catchy tunes have taken the world by storm. While One Direction has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2015, they are still compared to <a href=#>BTS's success</a>.</p><p>A strong fan base and gifted vocals are two of the main reasons why One Direction and BTS achieved new career heights. From their music to awards and pop culture influence, let’s compare the impact of One Direction and BTS and their success over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-direction-vs-bts-net-worth>One Direction Vs. BTS: Net Worth</h2><p>When bands have sold-out concert venues and Billboard-topping singles, they earn millions. One Direction had a net worth of $398 million when they disbanded in 2015. Their revenue came from concerts, music, and merchandise sale, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Nation</a>. BTS, on the other hand, has a net worth of $450 million. Their earnings have increased since their record label went public in the stock market, and each member was given a few shares.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Buy, Buy, Buy: The 5 Richest Boy Bands Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=head-bopping-music>Head bopping music</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>One Direction enamored the youth</a> with their catchy pop-rock music talking about friendship and love.
