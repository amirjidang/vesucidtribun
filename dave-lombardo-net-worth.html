At the age of eight, he bought a set of bongo drums with a Santana record for show and tell in school. He played the bongos along with the record. This experience has inspired his musical interest in drums and he was prompted to join the school band where he played the marching drum. When he was already in high school, he had established himself as a drummer on the rise. He performed with several bands and performed regularly with this group Escape in the late 70s and early 80s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David Lombardo formed the band Slayer in the early 80s and it started to gain widespread notice. However, he left the band in the early 90s so he can be present for the birth of his first child. In 2011, he returned to the Slayer lineup and has continued to record and tour with the band while he was also recording track with his side project PHILM.</p><p>Lombardo is most widely known as a very aggressive heavy metal drummer though his exceptional skill far surpasses the title. Drummer World gave him the title “the godfather of double bass” with his “astonishingly innovative” use of the drums. He has a significant influence on the metal scene and has inspired many modern metal drummers, especially trash metal and death metal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm2amraOesKqtzWibmq6VYrmwucGaqZ2nXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
