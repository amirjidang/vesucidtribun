Elsie, daughter of an engineer and jewelry shop owner, died at the age of 80 on Monday, Sept. 22.</p><p>The Judge actor, 49, recalled how his father Robert proposed to his mother during a New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles game in the '60s. Elsie always dreamed of becoming a comedienne, but later struggled with alcoholism. She went to treatment and got sober in the '90s, and dealt afterwards with several decades of heart disease.</p><p>"While I strived to have the kind of success that eluded her, my own addiction repeatedly forbade it," Downey Jr. wrote. "In the summer of 2004, I was in bad shape. She called me out of the blue, and I admitted everything. I don't remember what she said, but I haven't drank or used since."</p><p>Downey Jr. has famously dealt with his own addictions and has spent time behind bars. His 20-year-old son Indio was charged with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia last month.</p><p>The actor and his mom both overcame their demons, but Elsie hit a rough patch once again when she suffered cardiac arrest and was put on life support in March.</p><p>"Her wishes were to be left to die if there wasn't a reasonable chance of recovery, which for some time there was. I returned from filming the Avengers sequel in June, went straight to see her," he recalled. "To my amazement, she was completely lucid, interactive, mugging + pulling faces."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After a few seizures, Downey Jr. —&nbsp;who is expecting his second child with wife <strong>Susan</strong> — brought his mom home for hospice. She died at 11 p.m. this Monday. "She was my role model as an actor, and as a woman who got sober and stayed that way. She was also reclusive, self-deprecating, a stoic Scotch-German rural Pennsylvanian, a ball buster, stubborn, and happy to hold a grudge," Downey Jr. continued.</p><p>"My ambition, tenacity, loyalty, 'moods,' grandiosity, occasional passive aggression, and my faith. That's all her…and I wouldn't have it any other way," he added. "If anyone out there has a mother, and she's not perfect, please call her and say you love her anyway."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5w6iup52pYrezec%2BepaxlmJqus8DFnqOtZaSntqPB055kraddnba0ecuaq55lnaTBqbHRZpylq5maenN8kG1pcHFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
