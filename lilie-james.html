Her death was ruled homicide. The suspect called the Police to tip-off before committing suicide.</p><h2>Who killed Lilie James?</h2><p>The Police responded to St Cathedral School just before midnight after they had received a Tip-off call. Upon arrival, they encountered a horrific scene. Lilie James, a bright young woman, was found dead with extensive head injuries inside the bathroom of the elite private school in Sydney. Her death was ruled a homicide. The detectives believe she was murdered with a hammer.</p><p>She was last seen alive at around 7 p.m. on October 25, entering the gymnasium bathroom on a CCTV footage, followed by a 24-year-old Paul Thijssen, who was seen entering the bathroom after her. He later left the bathroom alone. Lilie’s body was discovered by the Police before midnight the same day.</p><p>According to the reports, Lilie had been seeing Paul Thijssan for five weeks and ended the relationship.&nbsp;It is believed that the break-up was the motive behind the violent crime. It is unclear how he managed to get Lilie to see him after hours, but their meeting is believed to have prompted an argument, which led to the bone-chilling murder.</p><h2>What happened to Paul Thijssen?</h2><p>Paul Thijssen used Lilie’s phone to text her father to come to school and collect her. He was identified and named a prime suspect after reportedly disappearing. He called the Police to notify them of a young woman’s death at St Cathedral School from The Gap in Vaucluse.</p><p>The Police launched an extensive search of the cliff-side suburb. They discovered the murder weapon in a bin close to the location where he was last seen alive. The Police found his body on a rock on October 27, 2023. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><h2><strong>The community mourns Lilie James</strong></h2><p>Lilie James was a promising young woman who was ‘stolen from us,’ a family member wrote on the GoFundMe page established to help the family with the funeral and burial cost. She was remembered as a kind friend and a talented sportswoman. She loved water polo, dancing, and swimming. “She was vibrant, outgoing, and very much loved by her family and friends,” her family said. “We are devastated and heartbroken.”</p><p>The entire community came together to mourn her and share her family’s grief. A candlelight vigil was held for Lilie in Sans Souci, where she was raised, on October 28, 2023. Her funeral was held on November 17, 2023, at Danebank, her former school.</p><p>Hundreds of friends, schoolmates, and staff members gathered to bid final goodbyes to her, along with her family.&nbsp;Her family expressed their gratitude towards the community for their generosity in the fundraiser and for their overwhelming support and love.</p><p>The head of the St Andrew’s Cathedral School, Julie McGonigle, announced that they will not let ‘the horror of evil’ define their community. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns also offered condolences to Lilie’s family.&nbsp;We offer our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the family and friends. May she rest in peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S5sK%2FApWaloZyesm62wKacrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
