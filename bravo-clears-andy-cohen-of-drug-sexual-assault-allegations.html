Discovery in February. The letter detailed Glanville’s claims of an alleged video sent to her by Cohen that depicted him as intoxicated and claimed he said he wanted to “sleep with another Bravo star” while “thinking” of her.</p><p>Although Cohen acknowledged the video and <a href=# rel=noopener>apologized</a> for the “joke” in a statement shared via X later that day, an investigation into the incident commenced.</p><p>Cohen received a second blow later that month when <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives of New York City</a> alum McSweeney filed a lawsuit that claimed Cohen “rewards Housewives with whom he uses cocaine with more favorable treatment and edits”.</p><p>The suit also read that “Cohen intentionally uses cocaine with his employees to further promote a workplace culture that thrives off drug and alcohol abuse, which leads to a failure to accommodate employees who are disabled and attempting to remain substance free.”</p><p>A rep for Cohen <a href=# rel=noopener>denied the allegations</a> at the time, telling The Hollywood Reporter that they were “completely false.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In light of McSweeney’s filing, multiple Housewives came to Cohen’s defense, including RHOBH alum <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>.</p><p>“Nobody gets a good edit on that show, that’s for a fact,” Vanderpump, 63, told TMZ on on March 2. “And Andy doing coke? I know because I’ve partied with him hundreds of times — in my business, in my house, in New York — I’ve never seen anything like that. I can categorically say, ‘No, he wouldn’t do that.’ I know for a fact he wouldn’t do that.”</p><p>The clearing of Cohen’s name arrives on the same day Bravo has revealed <a href=# rel=noopener>Watch What Happens Live! </a>will be renewed for another season along with fellow Bravo series’ The Valley, a <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanderpump Rules</a> spinoff, Married to Medicine, <a href=# rel=noopener>Top Chef</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Southern Charm</a>, Southern Hospitality and <a href=# rel=noopener>Below Deck</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmrmaakeqS4xJqprGWRo7G6ecKon56mXaSzbrDRrp5mq5WtwqK4jJqqrJmlocFurculnKCZpJ68r7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
