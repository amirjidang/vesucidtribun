Sure, they‚Äôre two great musical talents, but one‚Äôs an ex-Disney pop star, and the other an introspective, alternative hip-hopper. But their two worlds collided when the pair teamed up for a track called ‚ÄúA Sweeter Place‚Äù for Gomez‚Äôs album, Rare. It might not have been too surprising given that <a href=#>Cudi has worked with just about everyone, including Ariana Grande</a>. But as it turns out, Selena and Kid Cudi get along pretty well, and the duo had even gone on to build a friendship outside the studio (though Cudi is not named among the <a href=#>list of Selena's purported suitors</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The stars got together one evening for an impromptu Instagram Live session, and since no one can ever predict what can happen during a Live, of course, the unexpected happened. Let's just say, their conversation pivoted from zero to one hundred real quick. Instead of a fun back-and-forth, their exchange left fans bewildered.</p><h2 id=kid-cudi-and-selena-gomez-recorded-a-song-together>Kid Cudi And Selena Gomez Recorded A Song Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/selena-gomez.jpeg><p>Cudi and Gomez met through Gomez‚Äôs management, who put the wheels in motion for a collaboration.</p><p>Initially, Gomez had no idea about the potential collaboration as someone from her team reached out to Cudi without her permission. But in the end, it worked out because Gomez spoke fondly about working with Cudi and the friendship that blossomed from it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‚ÄúHe actually has incredible taste,‚Äù <a href=# rel=nofollow>Gomez said</a>. ‚ÄúThat's one of my favorite parts of him.‚Äù She also credits Cudi for opening her eyes to more musical influences and artists, particularly female rappers.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen we hang out he'll play all kinds of... from Ratatat to... I mean, he's the one who really has me listening to Da Brat, Missy Elliott, all of these, Eve, all of these female rappers," she said. ‚ÄúI mean, they're royalty."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Nicki Minaj‚Äôs Husband Has A Tough Past, But She Doesn't Seem To Care">Selena Gomez 'Felt Ashamed' Looking Back At How She Handled Her Wizards Of Waverly Place Co-Stars</a></span></p><p>On working with the Grammy-nominated producer and rapper, "It was an honor and I felt like I've known him my whole life.‚Äù</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their single, ‚ÄúA Sweeter Place,‚Äù is a dreamy, mellow track about meeting a special someone who can take them to a well, a sweeter place. Layered with Gomez‚Äôs soft vocals and Cudi‚Äôs rapping touch, the song takes the listener, to quote the lyrics, to a place ‚Äúup in the clouds.‚Äù</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-kid-cudi-and-selena-gomez>What Happened With Kid Cudi And Selena Gomez?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kid-cudi.jpeg><p>In Selena and Kid Cudi's unexpected Live, it started off like a chill hangout. Surrounded by balloons and celebratory decorations, the artists hopped on Live to share a glimpse of what they were up to.</p><p>A few minutes into the session, Gomez asked if it would be a good idea to try out Facebook for a Live session. She said to Cudi, "Could I go live on Facebook? Is that what the people do?"</p><p>Cudi agreed, then shifted the vibe by bringing up an incident involving a woman who went on Facebook Live after witnessing police brutality against her partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cudi‚Äôs response caught Gomez off guard as it pivoted a light-hearted comment into a much more complicated subject. Fans could tell Selena was uncomfortable, and a bit confused because of her response.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Kid Cudi Explains Why He's Against TikTokers Using His Music">Kid Cudi Explains Why He's Against TikTokers Using His Music</a></span></p><p>She turned to Cudi and said "What? No," as he elaborated on the situation, exclaiming, "That's sh... no... okay that's... I don't like that."</p><p>Her response was understandable, given the subject that came out of left field, but fans of both artists thought there was more going on than the awkward conversation about police brutality.</p><h2 id=kid-cudi-and-selena-was-a-unique-collaboration>Kid Cudi And Selena Was A Unique Collaboration...</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans on Reddit were surprised</a> by the fact that Selena and Kid Cudi were casually hanging out, but they spotted some details in the video that suggested there was more to their chill evening than working on music together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first sign something was "off"? The fact that Selena kept coughing during the clip. Fans speculated that Selena and Cudi were either high or drunk (or both) during the video, which they suggest explains the awkwardness and the weird pivot in the conversation.</p><p>While commenters didn't find anything wrong with Kid Cudi talking about the issue of police brutality, it didn't seem relevant to their previous conversation, and it seemed like Selena was caught off guard.</p><p>One wrote, "The way he‚Äôs just standing there like ‚Äúüßçüèæ‚Ä¶. Yeah," of Cudi, pointing out that he seemed like he expected the conversation to carry itself afterward. Another agreed, saying, "No cause why did he tell that story üíÄa menace."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Kid Cudi And Lupe Fiasco's Beef May Never End">Why Kid Cudi And Lupe Fiasco's Beef May Never End</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some commenters discussed how they would be just as awkward, even if they weren't under the influence of recreational substances, because of their love of true crime. One wrote, "I be chilling with somebody and then out of nowhere tell them some brutal fact of life thing. It's not ok. üòÇ"</p><p>Most fans agreed the whole video would be even more cringe-worthy if Selena and Kid Cudi were completely sober, but if they were really under the influence, it made total sense.</p><p>Either way, fans thought hanging out with Kid Cudi was probably quite a fun experience, even if it made Selena a bit uncomfortable.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay2tbSMpKCdZZOqsap50p6jnqaRYrSwucSzZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
