With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that there are many <a href=#>fascinating facts about Bonham Carter’s career</a>. On top of that, it makes sense that people in Bonham Carter’s life seem to be charmed by her including <a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe who once wrote her a love letter</a>.

As it turns out, however, Bonham Carter’s acting career only began in the first place due to a pair of tragedies from her childhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helena-bonham-carter-rsquo-s-mother-rsquo-s-breakdown-and-inspiring-recovery>Helena Bonham Carter’s Mother’s Breakdown And Inspiring Recovery</h2><p>During the early 2010s, Helena Bonham Carter was nominated for a long list of awards for her work in the critically acclaimed movie The King’s Speech. In February of 2011, Bonham Carter won the award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the BAFTAs. During Bonham Carter’s captivating acceptance speech, she cracked many jokes before touchingly paying tribute to her mother who she clearly adores.</p><p>“This is for all the best supporting wives — the Queen Mother herself, and my mum. There is no doubt that if my father were alive, he would have given it to her. She was the best supporting wife you could ever have wished for.” Bonham Carter’s mother wound up speaking to a reporter from the Daily Mail and responded to her daughter’s comments about her. “I didn’t know Hellie was going to say that — it was a huge surprise. But I was immensely touched by it, and she knows how very, very proud I am of her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>9 Sweetest Celebrity Mother-Daughter Relationships</a></span></p><p>Aside from talking about her mother during her BAFTAs speech, Helena Bonham Carter has expressed her admiration for her mom several other times in the past. In fact, Bonham Carter has revealed that she has her mother, who is a psychotherapist, read her scripts so they can talk about her character’s psychological motivations. With all of that in mind, it seems abundantly clear that Bonham Carter’s mom is a truly extraordinary person who is a rock when it comes to supporting her daughter. Sadly, however, when Bonham Carter was a child, her mom was going through a lot of struggles that made it difficult for the family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Helena Bonham Carter was only five years old, her mother suffered a mental breakdown that reportedly left her mostly bedridden for three years.

Of course, people developing tumors seems to be a lot more common today, and a lot of regular people and <a href=#>many stars have beaten cancer</a>. Still, it always is a little bit scary when someone you love has a tumor, whether it is benign or not. After learning about his tumor, Bonham Carter’s father opted to undergo surgery to have it removed. While most people who undergo that surgery suffer little to no serious side effects, that wasn’t the case for Bonham Carter’s dad.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Girl With Tumor Asks Internet For Dog Photos, Internet Delivers</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for the entire family, something went seriously wrong during Helena Bonham Carter’s father’s surgery and he suffered a stroke. As a result, Bonham Carter’s father was left half-paralyzed which meant he had to use a wheelchair the rest of his life, he was partially blind, and he had other health issues. While speaking to the Sun in 2019, Bonham Carter spoke her father who passed in 2004.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was an amazing man with amazing determination. He had this alphabet board to talk with. Instead of answering with ‘no’ or ‘yes’ he would answer in an incredibly long sentence. But he had depression and felt terribly guilty that he was a burden.”</p><p>When Bonham Carter’s father was left paralyzed, her brothers were off at school and her mom could only do so much. As a result, when Bonham Carter barely was a teen, she took care of her dad. In the aforementioned interview with The Sun, Bonham Carter revealed the stresses of taking care of her father when she was a kid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired her acting career</a>. “My way of coping at 13 was I found an agent. I thought, ‘f*** this, I’m going to invent my own life’. It was a refusal to accept what happened.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqSVo65urs6nn5qlXZius8DEq6pmm5ieuaW0zqibZqyilrSmsNhmm56ZpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
