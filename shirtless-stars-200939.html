Hollywood’s sexiest leading men, including Jason Momoa, Ryan Reynolds, Channing Tatum and more, aren’t shy about their rocking bodies.
In fact, the hottest men in the entertainment industry often show off their toned abs and physique while sharing tips, tricks and diet secrets with their fans. That was the case when Momoa was named GQ Man of the Year in 2019.
The Aquaman star, who got his start as a model before playing the hunky underwater superhero in 2018, revealed that he doesn’t have one idea as to what it means to be a “sexy” actor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Maybe that’s an attractive thing – the guys I love and follow are like that, they’re doers, everyone from a musical friend to someone who’s an outdoorsman.”</p><p>The Hawaii native, who earned the title of <a href=#>Us Weekly’s Hottest Hunk in Hollywood in 2019</a>, added: “It’s important to be funny too and in touch with your feminine and masculine side. I just feel like it’s OK to be a man, it’s OK to be a sensitive man, it’s OK to be a strong man. That way, slowly you come into it all.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jesse Metcalfe</strong></a>, for his part, exclusively told Us in February 2022 what it felt like to be dubbed a sex symbol after going shirtless while playing John Rowland on <a href=#>Desperate Housewives</a> from 2004 to 2009.</p><p>“That time in my career was such whirlwind,” the <a href=#>John Tucker Must Die</a> star explained at the time. “It was a lot of pressure to look your best.
