Kukawski was reported missing on December 22 in 2021, and the next day, her body was found. The number one suspect, boyfriend Jason Barker, was later arrested by authorities. However, to this day, the case remains ongoing and the parties allegedly involved are still under investigation. Kukawski's job entailed providing financial management services to entertainers and high-net-worth individuals. She was the business manager for many A-List celebrities, including <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and her entire family, <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, Offset, and even Tupac. Right after her passing was announced, Minaj and Offset took to social media to express their condolence. Meanwhile, the Kardashians were kind of quiet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-angela-kukawski>What Happened To Angela Kukawski?</h2><p>A day after the manager was reported missing, police found her in the trunk of her vehicle far from her property. The details of her tragic demise are far too graphic to mention here.</p><p>According to the police statement, the acts of cruelty against Kukawski seemed to be done "with the intent to cause cruel and extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion and for a s*distic purpose, inflict great bodily injury."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Exclaims Ex-Business Managers “Were Trying To Kill Me!”</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before her passing, Kukawsi was living with her boyfriend, Jason Barker. Being the last person to come in contact with her before her disappearance, he was the main suspect and was subsequently arrested. The police announced later that Barker was charged with two horrible crimes. His bail was just over $3 million.</p><p>Authorities stated that it's likely that the crime took place in their shared home before he moved the victim into her car's trunk, drove it to Simi Valley, and left it there.</p><p>To this day, there haven't been any more updates since Barker pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, theories started to get formed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Someone on social media</a> said that if Barker did it, then he was probably paid to do it by someone who wanted her out of the picture for business reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As vague as that sounds, no one really knows. There is no confirmed information about who really did this, or even why. The crime is something out of a movie. One could only imagine such a crime happening in real life, with the victim being a celebrity business manager.</p><h2 id=celebrities-grief-the-homicide-of-angela-kukawski>Celebrities Grief The Homicide Of Angela Kukawski</h2><p>A partner and CPA at Boulevard Management, Todd Bozick, said in a statement to Variety, “We are saddened and heartbroken by the loss of our colleague, Angie Kukawski. Angie was a kind, wonderful person, and she will be greatly missed by all who knew her. Our deepest condolences go out to all of Angie’s family and friends.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the 29th of December when Kukawski's passing was announced, the rapper, Minaj, wrote in her Instagram story, "The hardest working, most dependable, the sweetest person ever to meet. You didn't deserve this, Angela. My heart breaks for your children. Rest in peace."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cardi B And Offset Dragged For Daughter Kulture's Expensive Fourth Birthday</a></span></p><p>Offset also expressed his sadness and disbelief on his Instagram account in a story, "RIP Angie, such a sweetheart, you helped me so much, talked to you every week. I am in disbelief. SMH. Prayer to your soul."</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-were-quiet-after-angela-kukawski-s-passing>The Kardashians Were Quiet After Angela Kukawski's Passing</h2><p>Kukawski had been missing for seven days before the police made an announcement of her passing, and the Kardashians were nowhere to be found. The fans thought that this was very odd. Given the fact that Kukawski used to work closely with Kim Kardashian, people expected a personal statement about her disappearance or passing. However, there was none.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Taylor Swift's Midnights Album Release Date Subtly Shading Kim Kardashian?</a></span></p><p>The Kardashians made a statement only after the police announced her passing on the 29th of December, 2021.</p><p>"Angela was truly the best. She cared about every one of us and made impossible things happen. She will be greatly missed, and we send our sincere condolences to her family and loved ones during this most difficult time," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kardashians/Jenners told CNN</a>.</p><p>Kukawski's passing was very hard on her family and came as a big surprise to the whole entertainment industry. People were rightfully scared because if someone who was under the spotlight fell victim to a horrible crime, what could happen to ordinary people who lead private lives? Whoever did it, be it her boyfriend or not, indeed was cruel and fearless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BVoa5ut9SkmLCrm556rK3RnZisoJmWu7R5zJqlmp%2BVp3qlscCtn2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
