In a cover story with Billboard, the mogul, who was reported to have given his former artists their publishing rights back earlier this month, says he initially made the move to return the rights more than two years ago.
“I decided to reassign publishing rights to the whole catalog in May or June 2021,” the 53-year-old said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But this was during the time that I was holding the Grammys to task. I was also getting major offers for the catalog during the [acquisition] frenzy back then.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With lucrative bids for the publishing rights on the table, Diddy says he had to reevaluate whether his actions and conduct matched with his desire to witness “reform” in the entertainment industry. “When I was looking at the catalog and everything, I was put in a position where I felt like I had to look in the mirror. I had to make sure that what I was standing for was my total truth,” he explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1427109884-1-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We live in a time where things are constantly evolving. And it was about reform for me. It was me looking at ways I could reform things as a person that’s been asking for change. It was just the right and obvious thing to do; something I’m proud I did. As a businessman, there comes a time when you have to pick purpose over profit. I’m glad that I’ve seen both sides. As a businessman, I’ve evolved and was blessed to be in a position to give the publishing back.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The veteran executive and entertainer also addressed prior comments made by Ma$e, who has been vocal about Diddy’s shrewd business tactics in the past. He says that he and his former artists and collaborators are on good terms and insinuates that the past is behind them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Everything’s cool and good now,” the No Way Out creator told the outlet. “You know, we’re brothers, and brothers fight. I love him and that’s it.” In August, Cam’ron announced that his It Is What It Is cohost <a href=#>had received his publishing</a> back after a lengthy battle with Diddy over the rights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1427109941.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Diddy’s decision to give up the publishing has received mixed reviews, with some praising the hitmaker for the gesture, while others, such as<a href=#> former Bad Boy artist Mark Curry</a>, believe the move was self-serving. The “Bad Boy for Life” rapper lashed out at Diddy via social media, accusing him of reassigning the rights to the Bad Boy catalog only after their perceived decrease in value.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ever had somebody owe you 50 dollars, when you needed it back, they didn’t pay you. Then, by the time they do pay you, the 50 dollars doesn’t mean the same as it did when you needed it,” Curry asked, referencing the publishing. “That’s how I feel… I wanted that when it was making money, not after it’s all gone. What I’ma do with that? In fact, it’s an insult.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Diddy’s forthcoming project The Love Album: Off the Grid drops this Friday (Sept. 15) and will include features from Mary J. Blige, Jazmine Sullivan, The Dream, Justin Bieber, Ty Dolla $ign, Burna Boy, Love Records artist Jozzy, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZqeumpyewKm1zaBkq6GXncG0ecWoqaadomKus8DIrKusZWFngHWDmGlqcG9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
