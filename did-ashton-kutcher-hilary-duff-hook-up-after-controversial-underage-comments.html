Kutcher was starring on the popular sitcom <strong><a href=#>That '70s Show</a> </strong>and Duff wrapped up her time on Lizzie McGuire. While they have had very different careers, the actors experienced the highs and lows of life in the spotlight around the same time.</p><p>People were surprised that <a href=#>Kutcher and Mila Kunis seemed to be close with Danny Masterson</a> and wrote letters praising his character for the judge to read. As soon as this news came out, everyone began talking about an offensive remark that Ashton Kutcher made about Hilary Duff. Here's what really happened between them.</p><h2 id=what-did-ashton-kutcher-say-about-hilary-duff>What Did Ashton Kutcher Say About Hilary Duff?</h2><p>Us Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher talked about Hilary Duff</a> when she was 15 years old, and people were shocked by what he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Kutcher was the host of the MTV reality series Punk'd. While <a href=#>Kutcher didn't want to star in the Punk'd reboot</a>, he hosted the show from 2003 to 2011. However, it ran for 11 seasons and had a few different hosts, including DeStorm Power and King Bach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ashton-Kutcher-Vs-Mila-Kunis-Whose-Movies-Do-Better-At-The-Box-Office.jpg><p>In 2003, the actor talked about Hilary Duff's age during an episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher's Appearance On The Talk Turned Into A Nightmare After Sharon Osbourne Got His Name Wrong</a></span></p><p>Kutcher said, "Hilary Duff is in Lizzie McGuire, she also has an album out. She’s going to be in a movie called Cheaper by the Dozen. And she’s one of the girls that we’re all waiting for to turn 18. Along with the Olsen twins."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Did-Hilary-Duff-Ever-Change-Her-Face.jpg><p>There are many reasons why Kutcher's comments are off-putting and creepy. For one thing, he is ten years older than Duff. In 2003, she was 15 and he was 25. He definitely shouldn't have said this during that episode of Punk'd.</p><h2 id=did-ashton-kutcher-and-hilary-duff-have-a-relationship>Did Ashton Kutcher And Hilary Duff Have A Relationship?</h2><p>There is no evidence that Ashton Kutcher and Hilary Duff ever had a relationship. It doesn't seem that they have ever even been friends.</p><p>Hilary Duff doesn't seem to have commented on what Ashton Kutcher said about her. If she was a fan of Punk'd, she might have watched the 2003 episode when he mentioned her.</p><p>At the very least, she has likely seen his comments now since the story has gone viral. Fans can only speculate about how Duff felt about it since she hasn't explained her feelings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hilary-duff-cheaper-by-the-dozen.jpg><p>However, the actors have worked together. They co-starred in the 2003 comedy Cheaper by the Dozen, which is a remake of the first movie that was released in 1950.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The One Reason Ashton Kutcher Found It Challenging To Act Alongside Natalie Portman</a></span></p><p>The film stars Bonnie Hunt and Steve Martin as Kate and Tom Baker, a married couple who have 12 children. They love each other and are happy to be raising their kids, although of course, their lives are often wild and chaotic.</p><p>Duff played Lorraine Baker, one of Kate and Tom's kids. Kutcher played Hank, a character who dates Piper Perabo's character Nora Baker. Hank is a jerk and only cares about becoming a famous actor. He has a huge ego and often talks about how everyone recognizes him everywhere he goes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-ashton-kutcher-hook-up-with-hilary-duff-after-his-controversial-comments_-the-truth-about-their-relationship.jpg><p>In one scene, he says, "It's gettin' so as I can hardly go out in public any more. I mean, really, between the autograph hounds and the paparazzi..." He continued, "I've never actually seen them, but, you know, they hide in the bush and... they get their shot."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilary Duff Was Wildly Underpaid For 'Lizzie McGuire,' And So Was The Rest Of The Cast</a></span></p><p>Duff was around 15 years old when Cheaper by the Dozen came out. At the time, fans loved watching Duff in The Lizzie McGuire Show, but she was also just starting her successful movie career. She starred in the 2004 movies A Cinderella Story and Raise Your Voice. In 2005, she starred in The Perfect Man alongside Heather Locklear and Cheaper By The Dozen 2. In 2006, she co-starred in Material Girls with her sister Haylie Duff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duff doesn't seem to have talked about starring in Cheaper by the Dozen alongside Kutcher. He mostly acted in scenes opposite Perabo since they played love interests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashton-kutcher.jpg><p>In 2003, Duff was busy balancing her music and acting careers. In an interview with Texas Monthly, she said, "Never, ever give up your dream. If you are a kid, have a family behind you all the way. Study your craft and respect those who have gone before you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, she also talked about how famous she was becoming. She said, "My life has changed tremendously, mostly if I trip or spill something I am nervous everyone saw it! There is a lot of privilege as well as responsibility when you are on TV. I have met amazing people like Nelson Mandela and Steven Tyler but I live a very normal life. I do chores around the house and take care of my pets and go to school like all of my friends."</p><p>While she hasn't mentioned how she feels about Kutcher, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duff has opened up about struggling with an eating disorder</a>. It sounds like it was very difficult to be a young actress and singer who got so much attention. As Duff told Cosmopolitan UK, “Girls are mean. I experienced normal bullying like everybody else. That was a really rough time to be in the public eye, and that definitely triggered a bad relationship with food."</p><h2 id=was-hilary-duff-on-the-mtv-reality-show-punk-39-d>Was Hilary Duff On The MTV Reality Show Punk'd?</h2><p>While Hilary Duff and Ashton Kutcher never dated, she did star in the season 2 premiere of Punk'd, which aired on October 26th, 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duff was told that she would be practicing in order to get her driver's license, but instead, chaos ensued. She stayed in the car while her teacher got into a fight with another driver. Later, the other driver forced Duff to leave the car, and she said, "Are you crazy? My purse is in there! I'm a student driver." After the other driver stole the car, the teacher yelled at Duff and said that she was wrong to do that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/These-Are-Hilary-Duffs-Highest-Earning-Movies.jpg><p>When the driver asked about her movie career, she stood up for herself and said "So you think that because I have money I'm just going to buy the car?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that point in the episode, Duff got her purse back. Kutcher left his hiding spot and yelled "I saw the whole thing!" She started laughing and playfully hit him in the arm. She didn't seem upset at all, but again, fans can't be sure what she really thought about Kutcher at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlsCpwM6nZKStpJi1pr6MoaClmaKueqXBxZ9koaefoHq2vIyana2domKwsLrTq6avnaKotqK4jK6lnZ2ilrSmecKopKadnqnAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
