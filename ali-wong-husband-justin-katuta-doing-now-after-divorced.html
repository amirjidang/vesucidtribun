A Harvard Business School graduate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's an LA-based entrepreneur with an impressive resume</a>.

The couple has two daughters together, Mari, born in 2015, and Nikki, born in 2017. Their faces are never featured on Ali or Justin's social media pages, and they have never joined their parents on the red carpet. A source confirmed to People Magazine that despite the divorce, the couple "will continue to co-parent lovingly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ali-wong-and-her-ex-husband-justin-hakuta-attending-the-la-premiere-of-wreck-it-ralph-2.jpg><p>The couple relies on the help of a nanny as well. During an interview with Paste Magazine, the comedian talked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how oddly comfortable she felt leaving her kids with a nanny for the first time.</a> "I didn't expect to be so comfortable handing my child off to a nanny without getting any of her information. As soon as she arrived at my house, I threw my baby in her arms and went to Target," said Ali. <a href=#>Some celebrities refuse to hire nannies</a> but finding the right one can help ensure parents get back to work and continue a normal routine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Things Celebrity Nannies Revealed About Their Clients</a></span></p><p>Ali got candid about how much her relationship changed after having a baby as well. Speaking with Paste Magazine, she explained she wasn't expecting to feel so unlike herself after giving birth. "I did not expect how much I would not feel like a sexual being anymore. How much my body would still continue to be sacrificed for the baby," said Ali.</p><p>Despite all the lows of parenthood, becoming a mother brought about some of her highest highs as well. "It's simple stuff—the first time she laughed, I'd just kissed her cheek a bunch of times in a row, and she started giggling. And I just felt this euphoria. It's really simple, but I was really, really excited," said Ali in the interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-ali-wong-39-s-ex-husband-do-for-a-living>What Does Ali Wong's Ex-Husband Do For A Living?</h2><p>Ali Wong's ex-husband is a catch, and the comedian knew it right when she met him. During her stand-up special, Baby Cobra, Ali shares the story of how the two met at a wedding reception in 2010. When she learned he was attending Harvard Business School, she worked on "trapping" him. "And I trapped his a-- initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose because I knew that he was a catch," said Ali in Baby Cobra.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ali-wong-at-variety-s-2019-power-of-women-los-angeles.jpg><p>Justin has had an array of impressive jobs and positions over the years. According to his LinkedIn, his most recent role was at GoodRX, where he served as a Senior Product Manager and Vice President of Products. His profile has not been updated since 2019 when he left GoodRX.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 8 Celebrities Started Out As Stand-Up Comedians</a></span></p><p>Justin is the son of Japanese-American inventor and TV personality Ken Hakuta, who many know as Dr. Fad. The Dr. Fad Show ran from 1988 to 1994. The program was geared towards children, promoting creativity and inventiveness to its viewers. Justin's family was dead-set on ensuring he signed a prenup before marrying Ali, which was undoubtedly a direct result of wanting to protect their own successes as well as their sons. Their prenup was incredibly straightforward,<a href=#> unlike a lot of the prenups we see in Hollywood these days</a>.</p><h2 id=has-ali-wong-or-her-ex-husband-justin-hakuta-started-dating-again>Has Ali Wong or Her Ex-Husband Justin Hakuta Started Dating Again?</h2><p>We don't know if Justin Hakuta has started dating again after his split from Ali Wong. The entrepreneur keeps a low profile, <a href=#>with his latest post on Instagram</a> dating back to November 2021. Ali, however, has been dating since the divorce. Her most high-profile suitor since the split was Saturday Night Live alum, Bill Hader.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to sources close to the pair, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two dated for a couple of months in 2022</a>. "Only a small circle of A-list comedians know, and everyone was thrilled about it. [Their friends] helped them protect the relationship in light of Ali's divorce," the source told Page Six.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ali-wong-at-a-2019-ascpa-event-in-los-angeles.jpg><p>Ali's second Netflix comedy special, Don Wong,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> was littered with hints about Ali's disinterest in her marriage</a>. The comedian started off by sharing how envious of single people she had become. "I, too, was once free, but like an idiot, I asked this dude to ask me to go to prison. And now I'm in monogamy jail, and I don't know how to get out," she said during her special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued by sharing with the audience that she thought about cheating on her husband "every five minutes," only holding back "because no worthy opportunity has presented itself."</p><p>Ali assured the audience that her then-husband didn't care about what she was saying about him during her stand-up special because "he's too busy living the life I wanted for myself." She goes on to explain he lives in the house that she paid for, tells time on the Rolex she bought for him, and hangs out with the children she birthed. Hindsight is definitely 20/20 in this scenario, seeing that less than two months after the special premiered, Ali and Justin were divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaFdrLyvs4yhrKyakaOxbrbUrKuipl2grrXB05pknaeZo7Ruus6wZJqepJq%2FbrDIr6arm5WZfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
