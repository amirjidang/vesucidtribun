"His long battle with cancer is now over and he is finally at peace."</p><p>"My dad’s love of country music and America set me on my life's journey, and shaped so much of who I am today," the New Zealand native continued. "Thank you to everyone who has kept us all in your thoughts and prayers."</p><p>The <i>American Idol</i> judge revealed at the opening of his new exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame on Wednesday, Dec. 2, that his father had been placed in hospice care.</p><p>"He’s probably only got a few weeks, if that. I've just been dealing with that the last couple of days," the "Little Bit of Everything" singer told <i><a href=#>The Tennessean</a></i>. "This has all come at a very strange time where it's typical of a career that has extreme highs and extreme lows all often at the exact same time. So [the exhibit] is bittersweet a little bit because [my dad] is the catalyst for all of this. My dad is the catalyst for me living in America."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It is the second heavy blow in a short space of time for Urban's family. Last year, his wife <b>Nicole Kidman</b>'s father, <b>Dr. Antony Kidman</b>, <a href=#>died at the age of 76</a> after falling at a Singapore hotel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZmptW7B0ZuYp6tdm661tMSrZKunkpq%2FtXnHmqpmnJmasW6txa2cq2WcpLuoecGaq62klWLEqsDHZpqappOav27DkG5waW9nZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
