The process typically involves injecting an enzyme called hyaluronidase to break down the hyaluronic acid-based fillers, allowing the body to reabsorb and eliminate them naturally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[It] could be associated with filler that is migrated, or it could also represent obstructed lymphatics, which doesn’t allow fluid to leave her under eye area,” Truesdale continued to explain Jen’s seeming puffiness. “This can be seen with chronic filler use and can contribute to an overall puffy look that we call ‘filler fatigue.’”</p><h2 id=aniston-is-private-about-the-work-she-rsquo-s-had-done>Aniston Is Private About The Work She’s Had Done</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/courteney-cox-and-jennifer-aniston.jpg><p>There may be another explanation for Aniston’s more gaunt look – aging. If she’s not keeping up with fillers regularly, even if she’s not dissolving the work she’s already had done, it could explain the changes to her face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It seems that her recent look could be associated with bone loss around the orbit, which is common for her age,” Dr. Truesdale went on. “Laxity of the eyelid skin and the cheeks is due to volume and facial laxity is best addressed with a facelift.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/despite-being-anti-plastic-surgery-jennifer-aniston-has-gotten-these-procedures-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Despite Being Anti-Plastic Surgery, Jennifer Aniston Has Gotten These Procedures">Despite Being Anti-Plastic Surgery, Jennifer Aniston Has Gotten These Procedures</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Aniston has spoken out many times against plastic surgery, but she actually has a couple of procedures under her belt.</p><p>In general, Aniston has generally been private about her use of cosmetic enhancements or plastic surgery, so fans shouldn’t expect her to address the speculation around filler anytime soon.
