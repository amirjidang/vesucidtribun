Attorney for Simpson. However, Kim Kardashian made her debut on her own in the entertainment industry when she worked as Brandy Norwood's stylist for a short time in 2004. 6.6 million, just below Barack Obama and barely above <a href=#>American actor Ashton Kutcher</a>, were Kim Kardashian West's Twitter followers when she was first listed in the pages of Forbes in 2011. Five years later, she has featured on the Forbes cover thanks to her successful mobile game, which brought in $51 million that year. She now formally makes her debut on the World's Billionaires list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to two successful companies, KKW Beauty and Skims, as well as money from reality television and endorsement deals, a few smaller ventures, and revenue from reality television, Forbes believes that Kardashian West is now worth $1 billion, up from $780 million in October.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Inside Kim Kardashian's Private Featuring A Bar And Lavish Dining Tables" href=#>Inside Kim Kardashian's Private Featuring A Bar And Lavish Dining Tables</a></span></p><h2 id=a-glimpse-inside-kim-kardashian-s-extravagant-kim-air>A Glimpse Inside Kim Kardashian's Extravagant Kim Air</h2><p>Kim <a href=#>Kardashian has made some intelligent real estate acquisitions</a> and sales over the years, but she also enjoys treating herself to luxuries. She recently took a flight on her brand-new private plane. The reality star's $150 million luxury airplane is described in detail below, along with the customizations she selected and the passengers that have flown on it thus far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inside of the airplane is distinctive</a>; light-colored cashmere is used to wrap the ceiling, headrests, pillows, and overhead baggage bins. On board are two bathrooms, and the interior is equipped with modern light wood. Kardashian made a point of mentioning how she chose to go in the opposite direction from the way a plane typically looks.</p><p>Kim is currently traveling on an 18-seater jet with leather seats and cream cashmere accents, which is reported to have taken her a whole year to create and design to her standards. The mother of four is a keen fan of interior design, so Kim had her plane painted a bespoke shade of grey to match her <a href=#>luxurious home located in Calabasas</a>. Despite its luxury, Kim's new means of transportation is believed to cost her $400,000 in fuel and an additional $100,000 in upkeep.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, Kim has posted various pictures of herself on airplanes on Instagram. She has also posted photos of herself being picked up by her boyfriend Pete Davidson after she travels away on planes. Kardashian demonstrated the new jet's incredible inside space and design functionality, which is obviously luxurious.</p><h2 id=kim-air-s-million-dollar-technology>Kim Air's Million-Dollar Technology</h2><p>With a top match speed of 0.925, the aircraft is intended for high-speed business flying. In fact, the G65OER holds the record for the longest flight in business aviation history, having traveled 8,379 nautical miles back in April 2019, according to Gulfstream. The G650ER, according to Gulfstream, boasts the largest business-jet cabin on the market, boasting four living areas, additional aisle space, and the ability to operate the cabin's entertainment, temperature, and lighting with a smart device. As seen in the video, Kim Kardashian's private jet also has a low cabin altitude, quiet cabin functions, and huge windows intended to promote comfort and lessen weariness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian has a flagship release in the world of private jets. The Gulfstream G650ER is <a href=#>a top-tier luxurious jet</a> with all the bells and whistles the social media star is known for. While it wasn't inexpensive, for Kardashian, it represents a drop in the bucket. Before launching her lingerie, bras, underwear, and loungewear enterprise Skims in 2019, the entrepreneur sold a 20% stake in her KKW Beauty company to cosmetics giant Coty for AUD$276 million. Given that her debut collection generated over $2 million in sales in a matter of minutes, Kim Kardashian's custom Gulfstream might not be the last private aircraft she flies.</p><h2 id=kim-air-s-many-customizations>Kim Air's Many Customizations</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian had to wait more than a year for the jet to be completed considerable delay caused by her requests for customizations. The jet offers four distinct spaces for entertainment, work, dining, and relaxation. It has 10 beds and can sleep up to 18 people. The plates and placemats are the exact ones the reality star uses at home, and the color scheme matches. She worked with designers Waldo Fernandez and Tommy Clements to customize the aircraft. Previously, Clements and Fernandez worked on the homes of Travis Barker and Kendall Jenner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a billionaire, having a private jet is probably no big deal. But <a href=#>Skims founder Kim Kardashian</a> has brought the extravagant mode of transportation to a new level – and the world watched in awe as she showed it off in a recent episode of The Kardashians .She shared why it's more unique than that of her rivals and how the aircraft is said to be from the same place Amazon founder Jeff Bezos got him – reportedly even costing more. There was a cashmere accents added into the interiors of private jet and Kim Kardashians gushed over the cashmere ceilings, headrests and pillows as she feels like doing an MTV Cribs for planes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Kim K Garage: A Peek Inside Kim Kardashian’s $3.8 Million Car Collection" href=#>The Kim K Garage: A Peek Inside Kim Kardashian’s $3.8 Million Car Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital FM</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Banking Rates</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWK4qrmMmqCrZZueum63wKubmquYnq6vv4ylrLGtop68tr%2BMamxpZZ2eua21zqdkqaqZq661sYyjnK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
