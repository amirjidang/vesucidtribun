She won audiences over with&nbsp;Easy A, which came out in 2010, and also brought her comedic talents to&nbsp;Crazy, Stupid, Love&nbsp;in 2011. Some of her more recent roles include Abigail in 2018's&nbsp;The Favourite&nbsp;and Mia in 2016's&nbsp;La La Land.</p><p>Let's take a look at how Emma Stone met her husband, Dave McCary.</p><h2 id=all-thanks-to-snl>All Thanks To 'SNL'</h2><p>For decades, comedy fans have enjoyed tuning into hilarious new episodes of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;each week. Some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebs said no to being on SNL</a>&nbsp;but many have done an amazing job hosting and appearing in sketches.</p><p>As it turns out, Emma Stone's husband Dave McCary worked as a segment director for the TV show. According to his IMDb page, he directed for the series from 2016 until 2019, and he also has writing credits for&nbsp;SNL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SNL&nbsp;is how Stone and McCary met</a> each other. According to&nbsp;Elle, Stone hosted an episode of the series in December of 2016, and he directed the sketch "Wells for Boys" that she was in.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The List, Stone wasn't always certain that she wanted to settle down. She said, "I was like, 'I'm never getting married, I'm never having kids.' And then I got older and I was like, 'I really want to get married, I really want to have kids.'"</p><p>In December 2019, a source explained to&nbsp;People&nbsp;that McCary has a "down to earth" personality and that he and Stone get along so well. They said "he’s not affected by Hollywood" and they own a house in Malibu together.</p><p>How did McCary ask Stone to marry him? Everyone is so curious to hear these types of stories.&nbsp;Page Six&nbsp;reported that he asked Stone if she would be his wife when they were in an office at&nbsp;SNL. The source explained it was "romantic." This sounds absolutely perfect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Amanda Bynes Met Fiancée, Paul Michael</a></span></p><h2 id=marriage-and-a-baby-on-the-way>Marriage And A Baby On The Way</h2><p>The couple has been together a long time and is still going strong.</p><p>As of September 2020, reports came out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone and McCary had gotten married</a>. According to&nbsp;People,&nbsp;Page Six&nbsp;got the scoop first, and they were walking in L.A. and both had rings on that matched.</p><p>Fans knew that Stone was engaged to McCary in December 2019, so it seems like they had a very brief engagement.</p><p>News broke in early 2021 that Stone is pregnant with her first baby.&nbsp;People&nbsp;mentioned that the&nbsp;Daily Mail&nbsp;published pictures of the actress with a pregnant stomach and walking around L.A. alongside a pal. At the end of 2020, Stone talked about being ready for kids.</p><p>Stone lent her voice to&nbsp;The Croods: A New Age, an adorable animated movie, and she told&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight, "I feel pretty good about starting my own pack. I don't think that my pack would be quite as physically capable as the Croods are. They're pretty rough and tumble and I don't know if my pack would be as rough and tumble."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Did Ariana Grande Do With Her Engagement Ring From Pete Davidson?</a></span></p><p>It seems like Stone has found the perfect partner in McCary. In 2018, the actress was turning 30 years old, and she was interviewed by&nbsp;Elle. She mentioned what she was thinking about as she left her 20's behind. Stone said, "My twenties were a really interesting time, and there’s been a lot that has happened in these past 10 years, both positive and not as positive. It’s weird how much turning 30 crystallizes your life. Instead of just living the dreams that I had in my youth and getting to do the job that I love to do and making friends and going through all of that, it’s like, Now what do I actively want as an adult?"</p><p>This is something that many of her fans can relate to, as anyone who celebrates their 30th birthday will feel very reflective. Sure, they might not be a famous actress like Emma Stone, but they're still dealing with all the same questions about chasing dreams and finding meaningful work and if their partner is the right one for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s The Makeup Artist Responsible For Dua Lipa’s ‘SNL’ Look</a></span></p><p>With a baby on the way, Stone and McCary seem thrilled to start on this journey, and since they both work in comedy and Hollywood, it looks like Stone has definitely found The One.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Did Nina Dobrev And Ian Somerhalder Break Up?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecSmpJplo6m8r7GMppyerF2dsrN5x66qm5memXqlrdWeZKabk5a%2Funs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
