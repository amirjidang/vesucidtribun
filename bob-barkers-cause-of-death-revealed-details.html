Though he never publicly addressed living with the brain disorder, the certificate claims he was diagnosed with it “years” ago.</p><p>News of Barker’s cause of death comes nearly two weeks after he <a href=#>passed away at the age of 99</a> on August 26. The TV legend’s publicist, <strong>Roger Neal</strong>, confirmed to Us Weekly at the time that Barker died in his home of natural causes. He is survived by his half-brother <strong>Kent Valandra</strong>, nephews <strong>Robert</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Chip Valandra</strong> and niece <strong>Vickie Valandra Kelly</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nancy Burnet</strong> — a longtime friend of Barker’s and the coexecutor of his estate — said in a statement that she was “so proud” of the work she and Barker “did together to <a href=#>expose the cruelty to animals</a> in the entertainment industry and including working to improve the plight of abused and exploited animals in the United States and internationally.”</p><p>She ended her message by writing, “We were great friends over these 40 years. He will be missed.”</p><p>Several celebrities also took to social media to express their condolences. <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> paid tribute to Barker’s animal rights advocacy work by writing via his Instagram Story, “It’s a beautiful day to remember to help control the pet population [and] have your pets spayed or neutered.

He will be missed by everyone I know! Heartbreaking day. Love to Bob always and his family! Thanks for all you gave us!”</p><p>Barker became a household name as the host of The Price Is Right, which is the longest-running game show of all time in the United States.
