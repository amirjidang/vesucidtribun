The drama-filled seasons are what fans love and we certainly don't blame them.

While he couldn't keep his name a secret, viewers and fellow houseguests were excited to have a Calafiore on their screens again. Considering these New Jersey brothers claim brotherhood to be the most important thing to them, fans want to know just how close Paulie and Cody really are.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Brother: The 10 Most Legendary Rivalries, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=big-brother-brothers-for-life>'Big Brother' Brothers For Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Big-Brother-Cody-Paulie-Calafiore-e1600975085407.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Big Brother' is all anyone can talk about, and with season 22 well underway, things are heating up! This "All-Stars" season has none other than Cody Calafiore returning for his second time, but this isn't the only Calafiore who has played the game. Cody, who made his first appearance in 'Big Brother 16',&nbsp;and his older brother, Paulie, joined the cast of season 18. Considering Cody was the runner-up of his season, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">losing to Derrick Levasseur</a>, Paulie picked up on a number of tips and tricks from his brother.</p><p>Although Cody made it far, the same couldn't be said for Paulie. He was the 7th player to be evicted from his season, lasting 65 days in the 'Big Brother' house. Luckily for fans of Paulie's, this would not be the last time they'd see him on their screen. Paulie later joined the cast of 'Ex On The Beach' and 'The Challenge'. Considering both Cody and Paulie are&nbsp;brothers, they not only share the game in common but everything else, too!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s How Much 'Big Brother' Contestants Get Paid</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cody-Pauli-Calafiore-Big-Brother-e1600975104652.jpg><p>The two are closer than ever, and always have been! Growing up as Italians in New Jersey, family is everything. The duo, who are only 2 years apart, grew up doing just about everything together. From playing sports, attending the same schools, working out and now, being "Big Brother" veterans. In addition to their bond as brothers, the two have made a number of appearances on talk shows and game shows, including 'Watch What Happens Live' with Andy Cohen as bartenders! The two have also spoken about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the antics they got up to as kids</a>, saying that everything was always laugh-worthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is no secret that the two share something special, however when Paulie found himself in hot water after making some less than favorable comments during his season, Cody wasn't happy. The current all-star said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paulie will have to answer for his behavior</a> and that he cannot speak on his behalf. While this definitely hindered the Calafiore name, it didn't stop these two from being the best brothers you could think of.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Big Brother 22': Why Was Christmas Abbott Arrested?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqJypYrCiuMCfoKiqlWK9osHLopxmmpmceqO%2Bzq2fnqpdmLyvwMSsq5qmpKh6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
