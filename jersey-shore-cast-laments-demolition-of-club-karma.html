Karma, the Seaside Heights, New Jersey, club that served as a bonus character on early seasons of Jersey Shore, was demolished on Wednesday, December 27, and its most famous patrons had some things to say about it.
“We got a Situation,” Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino tweeted in response to videos of the beloved hangout being torn down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the video, Snooki, 36, lip-synched to audio of someone saying, “I’m OK,” before bursting into faux tears as mournful piano music played.</p><a title=@snooki href=#>@snooki</a><p>My hoop earrings are still in the bathroom.

The club was shut down in 2018 after its liquor license was revoked following reports of underage drinking.</p><p>“There will be people with some good memories of the early days, but then later on, it became a very hectic situation,” Seaside Heights Mayor <strong>Tony Vaz</strong> told <a href=# rel=noopener>News12 New Jersey</a> on Wednesday.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Greg Lertch</strong>, one of the crew members demolishing the club, admitted that he was once a Karma patron himself. “Thinking back 10 years ago, I came in here and did some shots, drank some Red Bull and vodkas,” he told News12. “It’s fun showing up, tearing it down. Putting an end to the era.”</p><p>The former site of Karma is set to be redeveloped to house a mixed-use condominium building. It remains to be seen whether the units will come with duck phones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeqqOaxm6%2Fx6ipnmWTlsC1ecuapJ6mpKh6pbHMqKOirJmku267xWaapa2SYriivsyaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
