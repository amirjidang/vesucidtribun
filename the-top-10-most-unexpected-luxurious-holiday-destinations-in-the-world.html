From private islands to exclusive resorts, these destinations offer the ultimate in luxury and extravagance. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family vacation, these destinations offer something for everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the vibrant streets of Congo to the charming villages of small-town Europe, these hidden gems offer a unique and authentic travel experience. Get ready to explore the culture, history, and beauty of these lesser-known yet expensive holiday destinations, and discover why they should be on your <a href=#>travel bucket list</a>. So, get ready to be amazed and explore the world's most exclusive and extravagant holiday destinations.</p><h2 id=monaco---average-trip-cost-of-10-247>Monaco - Average Trip Cost Of $10,247</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monaco, located on the French Riviera, is a small city-state known for its luxurious lifestyle and glamor. It is home to the famous Monte Carlo Casino, as well as the annual Monaco Grand Prix, which draws in tourists from around the world. With its Mediterranean climate, beautiful beaches, and stunning architecture, it's no wonder that Monaco is a popular destination for the wealthy and famous. The cost of lodging can range from moderate to exorbitant, with the going rate for a standard night in a five-star establishment being close to $800.</p><h2 id=central-african-republic---average-trip-cost-of-10-651>Central African Republic - Average Trip Cost Of $10,651</h2><p>Due to its tumultuous past, the Central African Republic is regarded as one of the <a href=#>poorest countries in Africa</a>, with very little tourism. Due to civil upheaval and election-related violence, the U.S. Travel Advisory has placed this county on its highest travel advisory level, Level 4 - Do Not Travel. Due to the lack of tourism infrastructure, traveling throughout the country can be logistically challenging, with organized pre-paid tours being the best (and most expensive) option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kenya---average-trip-cost-of-11-574>Kenya - Average Trip Cost Of $11,574</h2><p>Since Kenya's tourism industry is more developed than that of its African neighbors, the country's rates can become quite steep, particularly when selecting safaris that cater to affluent tourists. These breathtaking lodges often attract wealthier and elderly tourist groups because they offer luxurious accommodations that let guests get up close and personal with Africa's wildlife.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Steakhouses In America</a></span></p><h2 id=marshall-islands---average-trip-cost-of-12-405>Marshall Islands - Average Trip Cost Of $12,405</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This island, located in the western Pacific Ocean, has expensive flights. The island is a <a href=#>popular destination for holiday</a> packages that combine all-inclusive resorts or motels with flights, necessitating a larger initial deposit. Otherwise, lodging and transportation are reasonably inexpensive, with taxis costing $1.28 per kilometer. Despite being a lesser-known destination, the Marshall Islands offer an authentic and unique travel experience, making it a perfect destination for those looking to discover something truly special.</p><h2 id=south-georgia-amp-south-sandwich-islands---average-trip-cost-of-12-874>South Georgia & South Sandwich Islands - Average Trip Cost Of $12,874</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These remote islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean are part of British Overseas territory and are one of Antarctica's most frequented destinations. Due to the region's extreme isolation, visitors must come by boat and possess a valid visitor's permit. The most popular way to visit this location is by cruise ship or yacht, which may be quite expensive.</p><h2 id=tanzania---average-trip-cost-of-13-244>Tanzania - Average Trip Cost Of $13,244</h2><p>Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanzania's national parks</a> charge significantly higher entrance fees than the continent's other national parks, safaris in this country are known for being highly pricey. The cost of accommodation is somewhat high, with double rooms inside the parks costing anywhere from $600-$800 per night, but despite this, there are still many more activities to investigate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zimbabwe---average-trip-cost-of-14-393>Zimbabwe - Average Trip Cost Of $14,393</h2><p>Zimbabwe is another country that has established a high-end tourist industry to suit this demand. Africa has earned a reputation for giving luxury as close to its wildlife as possible, and Zimbabwe has developed a similar tourism industry. In order to justify their exorbitant prices, the most opulent lodges in Zimbabwe provide exclusivity, solitude, ample space, and superb service.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Billionaires Travel Guide: Here's How The Ultra-Rich Travel</a></span></p><h2 id=antarctica---average-trip-cost-of-17-730>Antarctica - Average Trip Cost Of $17,730</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's easy to see why this is one of the <a href=#>most costly places to visit</a>, given that the typical cruise to Antarctica costs over $8,000 per person, while luxury cruises reach $15,000. Due to its remoteness, Antarctica is likely a once-in-a-lifetime destination, thus passengers are willing to splurge on a unique experience, However, it is important to choose a tour company that is cognizant of its environmental impact.</p><h2 id=botswana---average-trip-cost-of-17-753>Botswana - Average Trip Cost Of $17,753</h2><p>When people think of going on safari, one of the first places that typically comes to mind is Botswana because it is one of the most well-known and secure locations in which to go on safari. It is clear from looking at the list of the top ten destinations that nearly half of them are located in African countries, which are well-known for the extraordinary safaris they offer. On average, a night's stay at one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Botswana's most exclusive camps</a> will set you back over $2,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=congo---average-trip-cost-of-32-420>Congo - Average Trip Cost Of $32,420</h2><p>The Congo, much like the Central African Republic, is not a country that has been prepared for tourism. There is a lack of sufficient and suitable infrastructure in the country, which makes it difficult for tourists to move about freely. Only a select few people who have a strong budget are able to travel due to the exorbitant cost of everything, from vehicles that require continuous repairs to high charges for fuel and taxes as well as expensive lodgings, flights, and boats.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Paris Of The East: What Makes Baku One Of The Most Expensive & Luxurious Cities For Travelers</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Off Path</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover Africa</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGasn6V6cnyMpqasrF2qu6bEz56arZ2UYrm2xNSroKito2K1sLjInZiyZZSawLW1zZqroqeeqHqquoytn55lp6S%2FrbCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
