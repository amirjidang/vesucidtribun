  Still, with Sarah Jessica Parker being this glamorous actress and Andy Cohen being the fanboy type who turned Anderson Cooper off on a date by asking him about his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt, how did these two hit it off and became such great friends?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The&nbsp;Sex and the City&nbsp;actress met Andy on the set of&nbsp;The Morning Show&nbsp;at CBS when he was still working behind the camera as a producer. You probably&nbsp;imagined their first meeting being at some A-list party, too. You know, like how Carrie Bradshaw&nbsp;makes new friends.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A year after their first meeting, Andy couldn't believe that SJP could still remember him. He must have&nbsp;made a good first impression. They started hanging out ever since and the rest is history. If we're guessing what SJP saw in Andy, it's probably the respect and sincere admiration he has for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Caused Kathy Griffin’s Ongoing Feud With Andy Cohen?</a></span></p><h2 id=going-to-met-gala-together-every-year-is-their-thing>Going To Met Gala Together Every Year Is Their Thing</h2><p style=text-align:justify>If you hadn't noticed yet, Sarah Jessica Parker has always attended the Met Gala with Andy Cohen and not her husband.&nbsp; This tradition started without both of them actually realizing it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>When Andy asked Matthew Broderick about it, he jokingly answered, "No, 'cause you love it, right? And you're great friends. But then one time they said there was something wrong with that, so I said I should go now, and she said, 'No, I like when Andy takes me.'"</p><p style=text-align:justify>SJP has also confirmed in an interview that it became a thing because Matthew is always doing a play during the event. She also agrees that it's&nbsp;just a special thing between her and Andy.&nbsp;And we love how they rock the red carpet together with their fabulous outfits every year.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Sketchy Things We Need To Stop Ignoring About Andy Cohen</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-re-just-typical-besties-with-expensive-style>They're Just&nbsp;Typical Besties With Expensive Style</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Like&nbsp;most besties, Andy and SJP confide in each other. They're not just hanging out buddies when Andy visits NYC.&nbsp;In Andy's book,&nbsp;Superficial: More Adventures from the Andy Cohen Diaries, he confessed that he asked&nbsp;SJP for advice about&nbsp;a straight couple who implied that they wanted a three-way with him, a gay man who's never slept with a woman.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yes,&nbsp;they share&nbsp;explicit details about each other's sex lives.
