That is until former Los Angeles Lakers star and NBA MVP Earvin "Magic" Johnson approached then-CEO Howard Schultz with a business proposal in 1998.</p><p>"Johnson had been retired from basketball for several years due to his battle with HIV and had been focusing on business investments and philanthropic work, and NBC News reports he approached Schultz with a plan to bring Starbucks stores to inner city neighborhoods.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As Johnson tells it, Schultz was initially unconvinced until the future hall-of-famer brought him to a movie screening at one of the inner city movie theaters his company, Magic Johnson Enterprises, had opened.</p><p>"Apparently convinced that Johnson understood the market they would be entering, Starbucks went into business with the basketball legend, whose company's partnership eventually led to the construction of 125 cafés ..."</p><p>The value of Johnson's franchise rights increased rapidly, <a href=#>alongside Starbucks' rapid growth in the 1990s</a>.</p><p>He also invested in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks stock ($SBUX)</a>, selling his shares for an estimated $100 million.</p><p>Johnson did not build his business empire through endorsements because he identified brands like Starbucks poised for monstrous growth and seized those early equity opportunities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-family-and-lifestyle>Spends: Family And Lifestyle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/magic-johnson-excited-to-have-his-kids-and-their-families-join-for-yacht-vacation-people-00-00-05.jpg><p>Family is essential to Magic Johnson.</p><p>He sets aside money to live well and create enduring memories for his family, including paying for his children's schooling, taking trips, entertaining friends and events, maintaining his house, and taking advantage of upscale services.</p><p>However, he manages his expenditures by investing his earnings from his enterprises and career, saving, and adhering to a responsible budget that he has had since he was a small child.</p><p>Johnson's money mastery is well-documented, and his colleagues have long attested to his level-headed approach to wealth.</p><p>In 2012, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">authored an article for ESPN</a> ("Magic Johnson and money matters,") writing:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Magic was able to reach [his level of financial power because he always kept his eyes on that specific goal. While he was still playing for the Lakers, he made a deal that nailed down a percentage of the club ownership. This asset grew and grew as the value of the franchise grew; and when he sold it, it was a nice payoff.</p><p>"Magic also parlayed his fame as an athlete as a way to open the doors to alliances with established business entities who were thrilled to be involved with him in ventures of many different stripes. For the past 20 years, the cumulative success of Magic's business empire has grown to its present state.​​​​​​"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/richest-nba-owners.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Basketball Bucks</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Richest Billionaire NBA Team Owners And How They Made Their Fortunes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The NBA is one of the richest sports in the world, and these billionaires have invested extensively in this highly valued sport, earning billions.</span><p>Abdul-Jabbar is not the only basketball legend who has gone on record to say Magic Johnson changed his financial future.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2020, CNBC published</a> a piece entitled "<a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a> says Magic Johnson gave him the best money advice when he first joined the Lakers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Abdul-Jabbar, O'Neal credited Johnson with placing him on a better financial path:</p><p>"Even after O’Neal signed a $40 million contract with the Orlando Magic in 1992, he still didn’t have financial or business acumen.

neglected urban communities while making significant profits.</p><p>Johnson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold the business to Loews Cineplex</a> in 2004 for $100 million in cash, collecting a
