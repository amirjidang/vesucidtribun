It might seem like a cliche to say that there are celebrities who seem normal that fans can see themselves in them... but Van Dien really does seem like she is still the same sweet, quirky person that she was before she became Chrissy Cunningham, the tormented cheerleader killed by Vecna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like they wonder about <a href=#>Van Dien and Joseph Quinn's relationship</a>, Grace Van Dien's fanbase would love to know more about her personal life outside of acting and streaming. Has she had a serious relationship since she dated Gossip Girl star Connor Paolo?</p><h2 id=is-grace-van-dien-in-a-relationship>Is Grace Van Dien In A Relationship?</h2><p>People think that <a href=#>Grace Van Dien and Connor Paolo dated</a> as they were linked for a period of time. But just like Van Dien never said whether their romance was true or not, she hasn't shared if she has dated anyone since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design.png><p>A glance at her Instagram doesn't bring up any photos of her with anyone, and when she is interviewed, she mostly talks about how much she loved being part of season 4 of Stranger Things and what she does when she isn't acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/inside-grace-van-dien-s-relationship-with-connor-paolo-and-if-they-re-still-together.jpg><p>Van Dien's Instagram looks a lot like other people's, whether they are celebrities or not, as she posts about the places she visits and the things that she finds beautiful and photo-worthy. But while others sometimes open up about how thrilled they are to have found someone who they care about, even if Van Dien was seeing someone, it seems like she might decide not to post about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Biggest Behind The Scenes Secrets Of Stranger Things Season 4</a></span></p><p>While Van Dien doesn't talk about her dating life, many of her Stranger Things co-stars are in relationships. And they sometimes share with fans how they feel about their significant others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David Harbour gushes about his wife Lily Allen on a regular basis and Millie Bobby Brown posted a sweet caption about her boyfriend Jake Bongiovi at the end of 2022, saying that he's her "partner for life."</p><p>Finn Wolfhard has been dating Elsie Richter since 2021, and he told The Washington Post that his social media followers said that if he didn't say that they were together, they would post her address online, which was definitely proof of how scary fame can be.</p><h2 id=grace-van-dien-has-a-youtube-channel>Grace Van Dien Has A YouTube Channel</h2><p>While the actress may not be spilling all that much, or anything, about her love life, Grace Van Dien does want fans to see other parts of herself. She has been sharing videos on her own YouTube channel and she covers a variety of subjects, from how much she loves her dog to interviews that she has given.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chrissy-grace-van-dien-stranger-things.jpg><p>However, the actress did open up a little bit about her past romantic life on her YouTube channel. In a video from March 2023 titled "I don't like to share any sad news with you guys," she said, "I've never been broken up with. I have only ever broken up with people."</p><p>She then shared that someone she was in a relationship with for a few months at the age of 19 died away recently. She said, "He's the first person that I've said I love you to that has passed away, which is a very weird feeling, because then you start thinking of all the other people that you've shared time with in a relationship sense. And you're not allowed to talk to these people anymore because they're not yours anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is 'Stranger Things' Season 4 Star Grace Van Dien?</a></span></p><p>This was a rare moment of Van Dien being very vulnerable, as she often shares lighter videos on her YouTube. She didn't say who her ex-boyfriend was, or reveal anything more about their relationship, but it definitely has affected her. The fact that she talked about this, however briefly, is a testament to how comfortable she feels talking directly to her fans in this medium.</p><p>In the video about getting a puppy, she shared that she had grown up with cats and dogs and that she was thrilled to have one just for herself. She is cheerful and positive in the video and showed her sweet personality as she kept thanking fans for their kind words. In another video that was more humorous, Van Dien laughed as she ate chocolate, and in another, she showed fans that she loves to paint.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grace-van-dien.jpg><p>In an interview with entertainment.tumblr.com, the actress talked about how much she loves creating when she isn't working on a movie or TV show. She said, "I love art. I’m not good at any of it though because I can’t pick one thing. I love painting, sketching, crocheting, knitting, embroidery, photography, piano. I rotate through all of those and pick up new ones along the way."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Van Dien spoke about her morning routine</a> with Rose and Ivy Journal and talked more about painting. She said, "I paint a lot to get out any emotion or feeling. Right now, I’m working with acrylic—I tried to paint with oils, but they take so long to dry and I don’t have the patience!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-grace-van-dien-make-money-from-social-media-influencing>Does Grace Van Dien Make Money From Social Media Influencing?</h2><p>While Grace Van Dien is enjoying putting more energy into streaming on Twitch, she also shared a sponsored post on Instagram on March 16th, 2023. She promoted Chipotle and shared her love for the brand, writing, "hey guys!! can't believe i get to tell you about the new chicken al pastor at @chipotle."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grace-van-dien-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>It's possible that Van Dien will make social media influence one of her income streams, which would be a great idea since there's definitely some money there.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Fascinating Facts About Stranger Things' Grace Van Dien</a></span></p><p>Van Dien has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, which means that she could charge quite a lot for a sponsored post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Shopify, if someone has over 1 million followers, they are a "mega influencer" and could ask for $10,000 or even more for every post promoting a product. Although so far Van Dien only shared the one Chipotle image, she likely made a pretty penny from that post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCpvsisqrJlo6m%2ForrGnqlmrJieu6i%2FjKCpmpuVYsOiuoydoJ6mXZ2ut7GMmmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1km6qVlri2vIywoK2gXZi8r7rOq2SpmZ%2BhvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
