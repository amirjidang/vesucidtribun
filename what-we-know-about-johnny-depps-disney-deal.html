No matter the avenue, celebrities will always find the road to riches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny Depp has been thriving in Hollywood for decades, and he himself has made a fortune. Recently, rumors began circulating about a deal worth hundreds of millions, and that alleged deal was thought to have some huge implications for his future.</p><p>Let's take a look at what's going on with Johnny Depp and the alleged deal that he's struck with a major studio.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-is-a-legend>Johnny Depp Is A Legend</h2><p>Over the course of his decades long career, Johnny Depp has been nothing short of a superstar on the big screen. The man knows how to pick a great project, and while some would have shied away from them, Depp consistently rose to the occasion, cementing his place in history with his performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A notable attribute of Depp's is taking on odd and offbeat characters. The man was responsible for playing characters like Edward Scissorhands, The Mad Hatter, Willy Wonka, Raoul Duke, and even Sweeney Todd during his career. These characters all offered up a legitimate challenge, but thanks to Depp's work, they thrived on the big screen.</p><p>Depp's characters were great in their own right, but so were his movies. His Pirates of the Caribbean franchise generated billions of dollars, and even his Alice in Wonderland movies made a fortune. Though he didn't always hit at the box office, the man had numerous hits that made him exceptionally wealthy.</p><p>While Depp had loads of success with a number of studios, he had some exceptionally successful work with Disney. He and the studio had a great partnership going, but eventually, things changed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Might Be Johnny Depp's Thank-You Gift To His Lawyer Camille Vasquez</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-let-go-by-disney>He Was Let Go By Disney</h2><p>Despite their long track record together, Depp was eventually kicked to the curb by Disney, something that took place some years back.</p><p>"According to a Washington Post report, Disney is said to have dropped Depp from the Pirates franchise just four days after Heard’s incendiary 2018 op-ed in the same publication, in which she claimed, without naming Depp, that she was the victim of domestic violence. Depp’s lawyers claimed that the actor’s removal from the multibillion-dollar grossing franchise was because of her allegations,' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hindustan Times</a> reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the blink of an eye, the Pirates franchise was undergoing a massive shift, and it was eventually announced that the future movies would star Margot Robbie.</p><p>Sure, there was excitement about bringing in a talent like Margot Robbie, but Captain Jack Sparrow was the heartbeat of the franchise, and losing the iconic character felt like a huge blow to fans. It was also a blow to Depp, who was the face of the franchises for many years, raking in a fortune along the way.</p><p>Recently, however, there was a shift in the wind, and suddenly, it appears as though Johnny Depp could be coming back to the House of Mouse.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Were Dior's Celebrity Spokesmodels Before Johnny Depp?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-new-300-million-deal>The New $300 Million Deal</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what exactly is going on with Johnny Depp and the reported $300 million deal that he recently secured with Disney. Well, his reps opened up these rumors, and sadly, it's not what people think.</p><p>According to People, the actor's rep said that this news was "false."</p><p>That $300 million number was something that was thrown around during Depp's trial, and it's not a legitimate deal that has been confirmed for the former Pirates star.</p><p>That said, a former Disney exec thinks that it could happen.</p><p>"I absolutely believe post-verdict that Pirates is primed for rebooting with Johnny as Capt. Jack back on board," the former exec told PEOPLE following the verdict. "There is just too much potential box-office treasure for a beloved character deeply embedded in the Disney culture," the exec said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This news will definitely come as a disappointment to fans, who were hoping that Depp inked a long and lucrative deal with Disney. As of now, this is not true, but of course, Hollywood works in mysterious ways, and this rumor simply could have been used to test the waters for a potential return.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Johnny Depp And Paul Bettany's Friendship</a></span></p><p>We do know that the Pirates movies are continuing, and if Johnny Depp is able to come back into the fold as Captain Jack Sparrow, even in a limited capacity, it will help make the franchise's future films more lucrative at the box office.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Amber Heard Slogs On With New Evidence Against Johnny Depp (And He Responds)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMo6ahpp6ueqWxz6mqZpyZqLumxYydnJqkXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
