I’ve been training months for this Men’s Physique body building competition. I had a lot of hurdles in my path, as we all have over the last 6 months… That said… I DID NOT LET ANYTHING GET IN BETWEEN ME AND MY GOALS. • I was lucky to find a competition, after of number of shows were canceled. I went from insane dieting, back to maintaining, then right back into dieting. I put my head down and let life’s curveballs come at me, observed, assessed, and executed. I won both categories I competed in and was awarded my Pro card. • Im not sharing this to show off, I am sharing to showcase that if we stick to the plan, commit to making great #HABITS part of our lives, we can, and will GET WHAT WE WANT. • Life’s path is paved with mountain after mountain, we spend most of our time climbing up and walking back down. The real MAGIC is in the climb, the journey, the process, as we only spend a very short time at the summit. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t CELEBRATE LIKE A MOTHER FUCKER at the top, and even on the way back down, but just know that there will always be another mountain ahead. • Learn to love the hard and the hurt, embrace the pain, enjoy the suffering…. then and only then, will you be unstoppable.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Chernow</a> (@michaelchernow)’in paylaştığı bir gönderi (21 Eyl, 2020, 4:34ös PDT)</p><p><br>He functions as the TV host of the program called Food Porn.</p><p>Micheal is the proprietor of Seamore’s and co-proprietor of ‘The Meatball Shop’ alongside his companion Daniel Holzman.</p><p>They extended their business from Manhattan to Brooklyn after it was opened in 2011 on Lower East Side.</p><p>He before long got hitched to a lovely young lady, Dona Chernow who is a previous model of Ford.</p><p>The couple has two excellent children who they cherish and worship to such an extent.</p><p>Micheal is a creature darling.

Flying blind never has made me feel grounded. • When I launched @meatballers with @chefholzman we had a very focused goal to open our own place, the plans to get there took many turns, but we set the goal and together went after it. • Just because you have a GOAL in place doesn’t mean you can’t change your mind, never means there is only one way to get there, however without having a goal, the chances of scoring are slim. • There is an age old piece of advise that I truly stand behind. “Without a plan, plan to fail” • One thing I’ll add to this, IT IS OKAY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND, BUT NEVER THROW IN THE TOWEL BECAUSE THINGS ARE WORKING OUT THE WAY “ YOU PLANNED” plans change, doesn’t mean the goal has to.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Chernow</a> (@michaelchernow)’in paylaştığı bir gönderi (3 Eyl, 2020, 9:03öö PDT)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaJmTqbyze8yimqGZlaF6pLTEq6Wor12dsqqzx61ksJ2ZnLW1ec2eq2avn6fBqXnAoJxmr5mgtm7Dx6hkoqajqa6ovsCmZJuhn5y%2ForzHsmRsaWBlhW%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
