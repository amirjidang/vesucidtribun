According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Telegraph</a>,&nbsp;Chie Kelly snapped photos of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mythical beast</a> in August 2018 during a vacation to the Scottish Highlands. But, fearing public scrutiny, Kelly held off on showing her pictures.

She told the outlet she was eating with her husband when the unidentified creature suddenly emerged.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was taking pictures with my Canon camera of Scott and our daughter Alisa, who was then five, when about 200 meters from the shore, moving right [to the left] at a steady speed, was this creature,” she recalled. “It was spinning and rolling at times. We never saw a head or neck. After a couple of minutes, it just disappeared, and we never saw it again.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>New ‘sighting’ of Loch Ness monster captured in ‘most exciting’ photos ever. The photos which show a “serpent”-like animal with its body on the surface of the loch were actually taken in 2018, but photographer Chie Kelly, 51, kept them to herself in fear of public ridicule.? <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/ecQrRSnE3R</a></p>— Sumner (@renmusb1) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 31, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It was making this strange movement on the surface. We did not hear any sound. There were these strange shapes below the surface,” she added. “I could not accurately assess its length, but the two parts that were visible were less than two meters long together. I don’t know what it was, but it was definitely a creature — an animal. At the time I did not want to face public ridicule by making the photographs public.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Steve Feltham, who has spent three decades chasing “Nessie,” saw the photos and offered his expertise.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“These are the most exciting surface pictures of Nessie I have seen. They are exactly the type of pictures I have been wanting to take for three decades. It is rare to see something so clear on the surface. They are vindication for all the people who believe there is something unexplained in Loch Ness. They are remarkable. I have studied them and still do not know what it is.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “We are lucky the Kellys have decided to go public at last. I have met the Kellys twice, and they are absolutely genuine. I persuaded them that these pictures were so important they should make them public. They warrant further investigation. It is not driftwood – it is a moving creature<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> and totally unexplained</a>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Attendees of this weekend’s Loch Ness Monster hunt in Scotland, the largest in decades, went home disappointed as the mythical creature was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Despite the failed discovery of Nessie, hunters claim to have heard "four distinctive noises" during their… <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/vfgcPo7l1J</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 28, 2023</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y8rq3NZqehp6SkwG64zpyfZqaVqMBuuc6nqq2domJ%2Bc3%2BTcG9vbWZmfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
