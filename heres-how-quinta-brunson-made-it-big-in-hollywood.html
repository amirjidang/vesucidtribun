Titled&nbsp;She Memes Well: Essays,&nbsp;it wasn't a <a href=#>book on the New York Times Best Seller's List</a>, but it's picking up traction now that&nbsp;Abbott Elementary&nbsp;is on its second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the autobiography, Brunson talked about her childhood in West Philadelphia and how her becoming a meme allowed her to grow as a comedian, writer, and actress, according to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>. Moving to Los Angeles gave her a new identity that she liked, but she explained her appreciation for the city that raised her, and later, became the medium of her award-winning show. Just like her shows and skits, Brunson's voice can be heard through the pages as her book is as open and authentic as she is.</p><h2 id=the-success-of-abbott-elementary>The Success Of&nbsp;Abbott Elementary</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021,&nbsp;Abbott Elementary was released on ABC and became known worldwide. The mockumentary is well on its way to becoming one of <a href=#>the most profitable sitcoms</a>&nbsp;as it tells the tale of underpaid but hardworking teachers at Philadelphia's Abbott Elementary. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, Brunson said the show is based on her own elementary school with her mom at the heart of it. Brunson noted as hard as being a teacher was in an inner-city school, she loved what she did. Likewise, the show is named after her sixth-grade teacher, Ms. Abbott.</p><p>The love and care that Brunson and the cast put into&nbsp;Abbott Elementary is apparent, especially with Brunson as the show's star, showrunner, and creator. The series released season two in 2022 and has already been greenlit by the network for a third season, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>. The comedy within the series and underlying messages of hope and equality have won the cast a Primetime Emmy, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe, among many others. As of this article's publishing, Brunson's only project lined up is focusing on season 3 of&nbsp;Abbot Elementary, but there's no doubt that her stardom is only beginning to shine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>America's 10 Highest-Grossing Reality TV Shows Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmys</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6divra1za2YZpqiqru0u81mpJqclWK2tXnBop5moZ5itbC4y7KuqKeUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
