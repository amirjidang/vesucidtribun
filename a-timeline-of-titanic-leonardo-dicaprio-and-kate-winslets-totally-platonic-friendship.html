And it's been almost 24 years since we were introduced to the adorable, but platonic friendship of <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> and <strong>Kate Winslet</strong>.

Leo and Kate have supported each other through everything that has happened in their lives since then and are still best friends today. Let's take a look at the timeline of their friendship through the years.</p><h2 id=1996---1997-leo-and-kate-became-friends-on-the-set-of-lsquo-titanic-rsquo><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>1996 - 1997: Leo And Kate Became Friends On The Set Of ‘Titanic’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Titanic wasn’t exactly Leo and Kate’s breakout movie, but it did make them a lot more famous than before they were in it. And not only did it start their successful careers, it gave them a lifelong friendship. After Titanic was released, Leo told Entertainment Tonight, “Kate is such a terrific person in general that our chemistry naturally happened on screen. We just like each other as people. As far as doing a love scene, though, we laughed about it a lot.” Although it seemed like they were truly in love on screen, that chemistry just came from a sweet, but completely platonic friendship.</p><h2 id=january-1998-they-were-each-other-rsquo-s-dates-at-the-55th-golden-globe-awards><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>January 1998: They Were Each Other’s Dates At The 55th Golden Globe Awards</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was the first time they went to an award show together and it was still the beginning of their friendship. Even though they were each other’s dates to the Golden Globes, it wasn’t actually a “date.” When they were asked if there was something romantic going on between them, Leo said, “No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. We’re good buddies.” They decided to go together so they could support each other on their nominations.</p><h2 id=january-2005-kate-crashed-leo-rsquo-s-interview-at-the-sag-awards><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>January 2005: Kate Crashed Leo’s Interview At The SAG Awards</span></h2><p>While Leo is doing an interview with Extra at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, Kate hears him talking about their kiss in Titanic and crashes his interview. She jokes around and tells Extra, “I can tell you right now that he hated it and he complained bitterly.” Then turns to Leo and says, “I just feel so proud that you’ve turned into this really special person, a really wonderful person. It’s true.” And Leo responds by saying to her, “I love you, sweetheart.” We're going to need some tissues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Winslet Turned Down The Chance To Star Alongside Leonardo DiCaprio In This Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=january-2007-they-went-to-the-golden-globes-together-again><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>January 2007: They Went To The Golden Globes Together Again</span></h2><p>After Leo and Kate went to their first award show in 1998, they made a habit out of always being each other’s dates to pretty much every award show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan Magazine</a>, “Kate and Leo reunite at the 64th Golden Globe Awards looking as glamorous as ever. They would both lose in their categories. (Leo was even a double nominee for his work in The Departed and Blood Diamond. Oh well.)” Leo might not have won an award that time, but he still had Kate right there supporting him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=december-2008-they-starred-in-their-second-movie-together-lsquo-revolutionary-road-rsquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>December 2008: They Starred In Their Second Movie Together, ‘Revolutionary Road’</span></h2><p>More than ten years after they were in Titanic, Leo and Kate starred in their second movie together called Revolutionary Road, which was directed by Kate’s then-husband, Sam Mendes. They separated in 2010 and got divorced a year later. It’s ironic that Kate and Leo were playing a married couple whose marriage was falling apart while Kate’s real marriage to the director was ending too. She always seems to get along better with Leo. When the actors interviewed with Entertainment Weekly, Kate said about Leo, “We have a level of understanding which I really don't have with another actor that I've ever worked with at all."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=january-2009-kate-wins-two-golden-globes-and-leo-is-right-by-her-side><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>January 2009: Kate Wins Two Golden Globes And Leo Is Right By Her Side</span></h2><p>After having tons of nominations, Kate finally won not one, but two Golden Globes in 2009. She won the first one for her performance in The Reader and the second one was for her performance in her second movie with Leo, Revolutionary Road. During her acceptance speech, Leo blows her a kiss and Kate says, “Leo, I’m so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love and how much I’ve loved you for 13 years. And your performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular. I love you with all my heart, I really do.”</p><h2 id=december-2012-leo-walked-kate-down-the-aisle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>December 2012: Leo Walked Kate Down The Aisle</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Titanic fans probably wish it was Leo marrying Kate. He might not have been the groom, but he’s supported Kate through all of her marriages. She has gotten divorced twice before marrying her current <a href=#>husband</a>, Edward Abel Smith (AKA Ned Rocknroll). According to Us Weekly, “The unattached Django Unchained actor, 38, walked the bride, 37, down the aisle and gave her away, a source tells Us Weekly.” It was a small ceremony, but of course Kate couldn’t get married without her best friend there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Leonardo DiCaprio And Claire Danes' Complicated Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=february-2016-kate-was-right-there-with-leo-when-he-won-his-first-oscar><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>February 2016: Kate Was Right There With Leo When He Won His First Oscar</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leo had been nominated for an Oscar multiple times, but each time somehow he always ended up losing. That changed in 2016. He won his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant and Kate was right there to cheer him on. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, “When Leo finally won his Best Actor Oscar, it was Kate who gave him a huge hug—and teared up during his heartfelt acceptance speech.”</p><h2 id=july-2017-they-hosted-a-charity-auction-in-france><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>July 2017: They Hosted A Charity Auction In France</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two best friends are using their fame for good and trying to help change the world. “In July 2017, DiCaprio hosted a charity auction in the South of France, and Winslet was there to support him. To raise money for environmental causes, the pair auctioned off the opportunity for a fan to have dinner with the actors. And at the event, they also reunited with fellow Titanic star Billy Zane, who plays Winslet's onscreen fiancé Cal,” according to People. After the event was over, Kate and Leo spent some time vacationing at his villa in St. Tropez. That same year Kate and Leo admitted they still quote lines from Titanic and that’s one of the reasons their friendship is so strong—they always know how to have fun with each other. And their (platonic) love for each other is something that will never go away.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Reasons Leonardo DiCaprio And Kate Winslet Are Still Friends Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqyZorKttc2eZKieXam2ta3NoppmpJWku6K%2Bw6hknaGTlr2ztc5mmKecXaCutbGMsKCnq5yawbR506irmqScrnqxuMCtpqehk2Kzs7XEp5usoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
