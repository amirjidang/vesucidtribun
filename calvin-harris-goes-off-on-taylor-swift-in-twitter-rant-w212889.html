Calvin Harris went on a Twitter rant on Wednesday, July 13, accusing his ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift of trying to make him “look bad” after it was revealed that Swift helped pen his summer hit, “This Is What You Came For.”
The Scottish hitmaker, 32, first confirmed Swift’s involvement in the songwriting process, and added his own complimentary commentary.
“And she sings on a little bit of it too,” he wrote, inserting an upside-down smiley face emoji."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though.”</span></p><p>“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet that was liked almost 3,000 times within half an hour. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it. Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you’ve earned a great one. God bless everyone have a beautiful day.”</p><p>Swift moved on in a new relationship with <b>Tom Hiddleston</b>&nbsp;shortly after news of her split with Harris, and the lovebirds have been jet-setting all over the globe in recent weeks. Her 2014 hit, “Bad Blood,” has been rumored to be about her former pal Perry; the friends had a falling out earlier that year.</p><p><a href=#>TMZ was the first </a><span>to break the news that Swift, 26, had — as many fans speculated — contributed to Harris’ hit. The site reported that at some point during their relationship, Swift wrote the song and recorded a demo on her iPhone, which she then sent to Harris.</span></p><p>A spokesperson for Swift confirms to <i>Us</i>: “Taylor Swift wrote ’This Is What You Came For’ under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.”<span><br></span></p><p>According to TMZ, Harris “loved it,” and the pair went into the studio to record a full demo, though they agreed not to go public with their collaboration.</p><p><span>Swift, who still retains publishing rights, instead used the Swedish pseudonym Nils Sjoberg in the credits.
