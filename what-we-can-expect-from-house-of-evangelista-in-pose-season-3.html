The season ended with the children of The House of Evangelista going their separate ways to pursue their passions, leaving Blanca to raise a new batch of legendary children.</p><p>With Damon leaving for Paris&nbsp;to pursue dancing and certain children&nbsp;figuratively "graduating" from the House of Evangelista, it's speculated Blanca, despite her poor health, will continue fostering new children and introducing them to the ballroom scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I believe there will be a new House of Evangelista. I think that that’s something that we could boldly say that Blanca will likely have new children in season three,” Pose producer Janet Mock told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “It makes sense—her children are grown. They’ll come and go. Family dinner may be bigger. I don’t know if Angel and Papi will have kids of their own. I don’t know what their home lives are going to look like. But I think that they’re also be [sic] very tethered to one another even though they go out and brand out and there may be new houses and all that good stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there hasn't been much news about what we can expect for the upcoming season, Mock shared it's&nbsp;all about&nbsp;"new beginnings."</p><p>Mock added, “We haven’t talked specifically about season three at all. And so, what will happen is that this will air and we’ll see what everyone feels. We’ll go to the Emmy’s, have a nice celebration, you know, be in a room together. And then we’ll return back to the room and then start fighting each other again about what we want [laughs]. But I think, this set up for this finale, compared to last season, is that we know we have another season so we wanted to do [a finale] where it’s truly about new beginnings.”</p><p>Although the original children of House of Evangelista are moving on, viewers would love to see the outcome of their personal journeys. Will Damon succeed as a world-renowned dancer? Are Angel and Papi still together? Is Angel still modeling? Whatever the outcomes&nbsp;may be, we'd love to see them all reunite&nbsp;in the ballroom once again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blanca, the&nbsp;house mother of the House of Evangelista, built her family from the ground up. She started her own house in season 1 while learning about her HIV positive diagnosis. In season 2 she not only maintained her household but eventually raised her children to be strong and confident enough to pursue their own aspirations. In the finale, Blanca's health is deteriorating due to her HIV diagnosis transitioning to AIDS, meanwhile fostering new children.&nbsp;She's constantly fighting&nbsp;to live while helping others, and something tells us that's not going to change in the upcoming season.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>BFF's Hailey Baldwin And Justine Skye Are Taking The Fashion World By Storm</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecKapWadqKWypMCMn6mopV2dvLa%2FxGamn2WVq66vs8SloKyskWK2r3nPqKqeZaOarrS7zWZqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
