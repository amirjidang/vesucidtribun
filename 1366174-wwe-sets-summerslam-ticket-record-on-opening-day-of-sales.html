Michael Cole noted on SmackDown this week that WWE shattered an event record for the number of tickets sold on the first day of sales. “We made history today. This is the 36th annual SummerSlam and never before have we sold as many tickets in one day for this event as we sold today for Detroit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There are plenty of floor seats and lower-level tickets remaining over $200, but all $150 and under seating is gone. It was estimated by ticket tracker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestleTix</a> that over 30,000 tickets have already been sold for the event based on the availability map.</p><p>To put that number into perspective, WrestleTix reported that SummerSlam in Nashville last year had just over 40,000 tickets sold in total. WWE’s official announced attendance, which includes all bodies inside the stadium, was 48,449.</p><p>WWE SummerSlam is set for Saturday, August 5 in Detroit, Michigan at Ford Field.
