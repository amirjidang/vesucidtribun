In the following, we're going to take a closer look at what those roles are, and if they're indeed, "beyond weird."</p><p>Fans don't seem to think so. We'll reveal what the fans had to say, while also taking a closer look at his rider demands. We can argue that the rider demands might be a little more difficult than his current rules for the employees.</p><p>Let's find out what they are, and more.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49218139.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Sad Truth About Paul McCartney's Health ">The Sad Truth About Paul McCartney's Health</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Paul McCartney battled depression in the past, while a heart surgery was also rumoured.</p><h2 id=fans-believe-paul-mccartney-39-s-rules-are-professional-and-logical>Fans Believe Paul McCartney's Rules Are Professional And Logical</h2><p>Credit to The Grunge for compiling this list, showcasing Paul McCartney's rules for his staff that are "beyond weird." The list has many rules, which included vegetarian only meals for his staff, no leather, strict social media rules, labeled wardrobes, neat setting, instruments that must be ready on-stage, and a calm security team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judging by those rules, fans don't really think there is anything that is "beyond weird." One fan in particular pointed out that the calm security team rules are actually a great idea.</p><p>"Honestly, that last one about the security team remaining calm while moving through crowds is pretty genius. More artists can learn a thing or two from Paul."</p><p>Another fan wrote about the instruments rules, "What on earth is weird about McCartney asking to have a large number of different instruments set up and mic-ed on the off chance of his turning to play one in a session? He's a genius and an incredible multi-instrumentalist. His desire to have this happen in his studio sessions makes him admirable and awesome, not weird."</p><p>Fans can judge for themselves in the video below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-02t120421-117.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Applauded The Way Taylor Swift Saved Dave Grohl At Paul McCartney's Party">Fans Applauded The Way Taylor Swift Saved Dave Grohl At Paul McCartney's Party</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift stepped in after Dave Grohl was put in an awkward situation with Paul McCartney.</p><p>Fans also weren't bothered by the vegan menu, with most pointing out that it was fair, while another fan claims the vegan menu for McCartney's team was insanely diverse and could've satisfied anyone.</p><p>Fans were full of praise for McCartney, and another fan discussed their best friend's own experience with the legend.</p><p>"One of my closest friends has worked for Paul for years. Apparently, he goes above and beyond for people who work for him and their families. It speaks volumes that most of Paul's staff have been around since his children were young."</p><p>It should be noted that McCartney also has rules for his dressing room, which might be a little stricter than the rules for his employees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mccartney-also-has-specific-request-for-his-dressing-room>Paul McCartney Also Has Specific Request For His Dressing Room</h2><p>Far Out discussed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney's 'hilarious' concert rider requests</a>, and it does seem like some might be a little too harsh.</p><p>Among the "odd" rules include, "All lamps must be halogen floor lamps with dimmer switch. One large arrangement of white Casablanca lilies with lots of foliage. One long stemmed arrangement of pale pink and white roses with lots of foliage. One arrangement of freesia. It comes in various colors so please mix them up. Freesia is a favorite."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/a-heartbreaking-dream-inspired-paul-mccartney-s-let-it-be-1.jpg><p>McCartney also has respectable rules for his rider needs, which include no animal materials being used. So that means the furniture should not be made of any animal skin or print. Nothing artificial either. The same hold true for leather, as this isn't acceptable for transportation either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like lots of other stars, McCarntey also asks for a dry cleaner before arrival, and towels on-hand.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:12</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49218139.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Despite Its Insane $30 Million Value, Paul McCartney Is Embarrassed By This Beatles Classic">Despite Its Insane $30 Million Value, Paul McCartney Is Embarrassed By This Beatles Classic</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Paul McCartney has his doubts about performing one of The Beatles' most profitable songs ever.</p><p>The list is a lengthy one, but in truth, it seems to be tame compared to other artists and performers.</p><h2 id=guitarist-rusty-anderson-revealed-paul-mccartney-instantly-made-him-feel-comfortable>Guitarist Rusty Anderson Revealed Paul McCartney Instantly Made Him Feel Comfortable</h2><p>Paul McCartney touched lots of lives throughout his career, and that includes guitarist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rusty Anderson who he also gave career advice to</a>. Speaking alongside Music Radar, Anderson discussed how welcoming McCartney was from the start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"He doesn't act the star at all. He's just cool and down-to-earth. He didn't put any kind of pressure on me. It wasn't like, 'OK, man, I have 15 minutes. Let's see what you got.' He was just happy and friendly and ready to make some music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Within an hour we were cutting a song. So even though it was an 'audition,' it didn't feel like one. See, that's the great thing about Paul - he'll give you time and space, but he's paying attention. He can get a sense about you very fast. He knows if you're meant to be there or not. Luckily, for me, it was my time to be there."</p><p>Anderson went on to reveal that working with McCartney was a surreal experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cYrqkr8Crq6edqah6s8HLnqpmnp%2Bneqm10maqrZmWm3qivsRmmZ6xn6OxbsPEoqmdZZaWu26%2BxJqaraGfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
