Because of this speculation has swirled since a December 2019 photo showed the couple backstage at the Rose Bowl getting close.</p><p>While the world first found out about Usher and Goicoechea in 2019, the two had known one another for quite some time. So long, in fact, that the mother of two likely knew Usher for the majority of <a href=#>the time that he was married to his second wife, Grace Miguel</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Usher's Baby Mama Pays Tribute To Him On His Birthday</a></span></p><p>There is no speculation that the Yeah! singer or Goicoechea was in a romantic relationship with the other until after Usher's divorce was finalized in 2018. But the two were on one another's radars well before that relationship came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is how Usher met his girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea.</p><h2 id=the-couple-has-known-each-other-for-years>The Couple Has Known Each Other For Years</h2><p>While the world believes based on the photos that they have seen that Usher and Goicoechea have only known one another for a short time, the two have been part of the same social circles for years.</p><p>After Usher and Goicoechea were first linked in December 2019, many believed that Goicoechea was a new lady in Usher's life. However, a picture that Goicoechea posted to Instagram in 2016 shows that the two have known one another for quite a bit longer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Usher Amassed His Reported $200 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In the photo, Usher is bent down, listening intently to what Goicoechea is whispering to him in his ear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is no indication whether this is the first time they are meeting or if the record executive is just saying a friendly greeting to Usher, they are very comfortable with one another.</p><h2 id=usher-and-jenn-goicoechea-are-both-in-the-music-industry>Usher And Jenn Goicoechea Are Both In The Music Industry</h2><p>The most obvious way that Usher and Goicoechea likely met one another is through mutual friends or acquaintances. And given that both have been a part of the music industry for quite some time, their paths have undoubtedly crossed a time or two in the past.</p><p>Goicoechea started her career with ASCAP, which is a non-profit organization that protects the rights of its members' musical copyrights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, she was the director of the Rhythm & Soul Department, a job she had until she left in 2016. Goicoechea then went on to become Vice President of A&R at Epic Records where she has been ever since.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Usher & Other Celebs Who Named Their Kids After Themselves</a></span></p><p>Usher, not only sings but is a music producer in his own right. The Confessions artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">owns the record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG) with Scooter Braun</a> who represents artists like Justin Bieber.</p><p>Usher has also been releasing albums since he started in the music industry when he was 15 after being signed to LaFace Records.</p><p>Given their connections and the fact that both may have worked with some of the same artists along the way, it would be hard to believe if Usher and Goicoechea did not meet at an industry function, an artist's launch party, or something of the like during their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, because <a href=#>the couple is so tight-lipped about their relationship</a>, it is anyone's guess as to how the two first encountered one another.</p><h2 id=have-managed-to-keep-their-relationship-hush-hush>Have Managed To Keep Their Relationship Hush-Hush</h2><p>​​​​​​​It is a fine line to be able to make people feel like they are being let in on social media while not sharing too much at the same time. Yet, somehow, both Usher and Goicoechea have been able to make this happen and keep details of their relationship hush-hush in the process.</p><p>What is very clear about the information that is posted on social is that Usher and Goicoechea are choosing the narrative of their stories.</p><p>So while they are comfortable sharing a picture here or a birth announcement there of their growing family, they draw the line at letting fans get too close. They instead, save small things, like how they met, for something that is theirs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even more rare still is the fact that Usher and Goicoechea have such a tight network of friends that their story has not been leaked by anyone in their inner circle.</p><p>In this day and age where everything is shared on social media for a moment of fame or to stay relevant, none of that is being done. Instead, the couple is choosing to stay mum about their relationship, their relationship status, and any future plans the two have together.</p><p>And for Usher and Goicoechea, it is obviously working for them.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Usher 'Horses Around' With His Daughter, Making Her Cry On Camera</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaeYrSwtcKonJyglZZ6tr%2FHnqlmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWimrmiwMiopaygmaV8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
