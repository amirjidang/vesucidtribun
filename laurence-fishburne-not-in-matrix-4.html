I hope it’s great,” he said (H/T <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>).</p><p>Fishburne admitted his Morpheus character is the one he'll probably be best remembered for but pointed out that it won't be the only one.</p><p>“It is probably the role that I’ll be best remembered for, which is great; it’s not the only thing I’ll be remembered for, which is better," he added. "What I get with him is I’ve got Darth Vader in this hand, and I’ve got Obi-Wan in that hand. I’ve got Bruce Lee, I’ve got Muhammad Ali shuffled in there, and I’ve got kung fu.”</p><p>We can't be sure what the reason for Fishburne's exclusion is but it could be because he dies in the videogame The Matrix Online, a title&nbsp;directors Lana and Lilly Wachowski allowed to be a continuation of the movies' storyline. It's widely believed that the death was faked but this could be proof of it being real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plot of the upcoming film is still unknown, as are the details.
