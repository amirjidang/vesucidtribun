Aladdin was a street rat whose wits turned him into a prince. That's an impressive underdog story that clearly stands the test of time.</p><p>What also makes him so compelling as a Disney character is his loving relationship with the princess of his dreams, Jasmine. However, even though they're a beloved Disney couple, there's a lot that most fans don't know about them.</p><p>Here are <strong>18&nbsp;Wild Revelations About Aladdin And Jasmine</strong>.</p><h2 id=iago-saved-their-relationship><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Iago Saved Their Relationship&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iago-jasmine-aladdin.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the direct-to-VHS sequel, Return of Jafar, Iago joined the good guys to spy on them. Believing in underdogs and redemption arcs, Aladdin trusted him. However, and very understandably, Jasmine and her father weren't too jazzed about having the evil macaw in the palace.</p><p>When Jasmine and Aladdin were fighting, Iago talked to Jasmine and used reverse psychology to remind her how much they love each other.</p><p>Though no one ever needed to hear Gilbert Godfrey sing in "Forget About Love," Iago did help save their relationship in a rough patch.</p><h2 id=powerful-women-try-to-steal-aladdin-a-lot><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Powerful Women Try To Steal Aladdin (A Lot)&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sadira-aladdin.jpg><p>While Aladdin and Jasmine are portrayed to be soulmates from different worlds, Jasmine wasn't the only lady interested in her beloved street rat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First was Sadira, who started off an urchin like Aladdin. Seeing a handsome and clever man make a name for himself enamored her. She later became a powerful sorceress who tried to steal his affections, but all her plans were foiled.</p><p>Other powerful women that tried to steal Aladdin for themselves were Saleen, a water elemental, and Brawnhilda, an impressive, strong princess betrothed to someone else.</p><h2 id=jasmine-is-a-better-leader><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Jasmine Is A Better Leader</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/princess-jasmine-leading.jpg><p>Even though the Sultan is the leader, Jafar was in his ear, and the Sultan takes time to try to groom Aladdin to lead, none of them are best fit to rule. Instead, Jasmine is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the first movie doesn't cover it as well as the series, sequels, and live action, she has so many more qualifications. Jasmine is intelligent and educated. She is thoughtful and pragmatic. Her father is clueless, Jafar is selfish, and Aladdin is ill-prepared. She's the only one most capable of doing right by the people of Agrabah.</p><h2 id=aladdin-fell-in-love-at-first-sight-jasmine-didn-t><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Aladdin Fell In Love At First Sight; Jasmine Didn't&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-meet.jpg><p>The second Aladdin saw Jasmine in the market place, he fell madly in love. She was beautiful, confident, and brave. He never saw people trying to help the other street orphans like she did, and knew he loved her.</p><p>Jasmine, on the other hand, didn't. He was a stranger injecting himself in a dangerous situation. While she was happy to save her hand, she didn't know if she could trust him. It was only when they started talking that she became attracted to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-second-most-popular-disney-couple><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>The Second Most Popular Disney Couple&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-and-jasmine-date.jpg><p>Arguably, Belle and Beast are the most popular Disney couple. Not only do polls show it, the&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast sequels, the success of the live action movie, the musical, and the countless cosplays and fan love they get show it off quite clearly.</p><p>However, Aladdin and Jasmine are an easy close second. Ariel and Eric barely speak to each other, other renaissance couples don't get as much buzz, and the newer couples don't have that nostalgia factor yet.</p><p>Congrats, prince and princess of Agrabah, tons of Disney lovers love you.</p><h2 id=carpet-is-the-only-reason-they-can-rule-and-travel><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Carpet Is The Only Reason They Can Rule And Travel</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Aladdin nor Jasmine have their hearts set on being rulers. They both dream of far off places and adventures. However, their good hearts are what keep them on the throne, together.</p><p>Worse comes to worse, they probably would lean on each other to make the best of being home bound rulers. However, because of Aladdin's discovery of Carpet, they can get anywhere quickly without abandoning Agrabah.</p><p>Without Carpet, they might not have been able to live every aspect of the lives they wanted.</p><h2 id=their-animal-friends-are-from-improbably-places><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Their Animal Friends Are From Improbably Places&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/rajah-aladdin.jpg><p>Even though Aladdin and Jasmine have never left Agrabah, they both have very unlikely best friends. Rajah is a Bengal Tiger, native to India. Even though the origins of the Aladdin tale can be found throughout the Middle East, India, and Eastern Asia, the landscape given is very Middle Eastern.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bengal Tigers are not very Middle Eastern, naturally.</p><p>Abu is worse, though. He's based off the Capuchin monkey, an animal native to South America. While Rajah could have been shipped over, Abu would be a very unlikely find.</p><h2 id=they-had-more-than-one-wedding><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>They Had More Than One Wedding&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-wedding.jpg><p>In the beginning of Aladdin and The King of Thieves, the lovely couple are finally getting married after years of engagement and adventure. They've decided it's time they make their relationship legally official.</p><p>Unfortunately, their wedding gets rudely interrupted by the infamous Forty Thieves.</p><p>Even though they go through a new adventure with Aladdin's discovered father, they cap it off with another wedding. This time, finished all the way through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-father-always-could-have-let-her-marry-for-love><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Her Father Always Could Have Let Her Marry For Love&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-sultan.jpg><p>Jasmine spends the entirety of Aladdin horrified by the prospect of marrying men that just wanted her throne. She wanted to be seen as an intelligent human, not just the ticket to a powerful country.</p><p>At the end of the film, the Sultan finally caves and gives Jasmine the ability to marry for love, not for power.</p><p>However, even though it's a happy conclusion for the couple, her father doesn't change his mind because his daughter is miserable and he loves her. He changes it because he approves of her male suitor. That's gross.</p><h2 id=they-waited-a-long-time-to-get-married><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>They Waited A Long Time To Get Married</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-genie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Aladdin and Jasmine happily got engaged at the end of the original film, they didn't get married for quite a long time. It took 3 seasons of a cartoon series and two sequels before they tied the knot.</p><p>Compared to their other renaissance counterparts, they took their time before marrying. Both Ariel and Eric and Belle and Adam (Beast's human name) married by the end of the movie.</p><p>Guess they definitely knew they were compatible by their wedding day.</p><h2 id=both-lost-their-mothers-at-young-ages><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Both Lost Their Mothers At Young Ages&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-orphans.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jasmine and Aladdin had very different upbringings. She was a princess raised in a palace, with all the best tutors, clothes, and everything she could dream of (within the palace walls). Aladdin was a street orphan. His father left when he was a baby, and his mother passed away shortly afterwards. He had to fight for everything he had, and still it was a miracle he survived so long on his own.</p><p>Despite how different they were raised, they did share a common trauma: they both lost their mothers when they were young. Losing hers left Jasmine with a father who couldn't understand her, and Aladdin's life was irreparably changed.</p><h2 id=in-folklore-jasmine-s-name-is-princess-balroulbadour><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>In Folklore, Jasmine's Name Is Princess Balroulbadour</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-and-princess-folklore.png><p>While Aladdin was the hero of his Disney movie, Jasmine still played a large part in their story. In the original folklore, the princess didn't play nearly as large a part. She initially was just called Princess Balroulbador, existing solely for her father and kingdom. Other than being Aladdin's prize at the end of his lamp, she wasn't that much of a character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Disney streamlined the story, adding more personality and character to the princess made the story stronger. After all, breaking his promise to the genie makes more sense when Aladdin did it for love.</p><h2 id=aladdin-was-willing-to-be-a-snake-forever-with-her><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><b>Aladdin Was Willing To Be A Snake Forever With Her</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-snakes.jpg><p>Throughout the Disney Channel Aladdin cartoon series, the young couple experience countless wild adventures. One of the most heartbreaking involved Jasmine and snakes. Mirage, a common enemy of theirs, believes love is a weak and shallow feeling. She curses the princess to turn into a snake woman, stealing her beauty and her humanity.</p><p>Against Mirage's assumptions, Aladdin chooses to eat a fruit that will turn him into a snake person, too. After all, he'd prefer to live life as a snake over living as a human without her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mirage changes them back, only because their love was more than skin deep.</p><h2 id=both-aladdin-and-jasmine-love-to-see-the-world><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Both Aladdin And Jasmine Love To See The World&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-travel.jpg><p>Even though Aladdin and Jasmine grew up in different worlds, they have important aspects of their personality that bring them together. They are both brave, have altruistic hearts, and crave adventure.</p><p>If there was a perfect date to bring a sheltered, experience hungry girl on, Aladdin hit the jackpot. He can help her protect her people while also showing her the world she always dreamed of knowing.</p><p>They really were made for each other.</p><h2 id=the-sultan-tried-to-groom-aladdin-to-lead-not-his-daughter><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>The Sultan Tried To Groom Aladdin To Lead (Not His Daughter)&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-sultan-vizier.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact the Sultan raised Jasmine to be intelligent and prepared for the throne, he cares more about her betrothed. The second he approves her marriage to Aladdin, he starts trying to groom him into a leader. He even wanted to make him vizier, despite his lack of knowledge or training.</p><p>While it's important to give Aladdin some training, he should care more about poising Jasmine to be the best leader she can be. She's the best one for the throne anyway.</p><h2 id=neither-has-any-human-friends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Neither Has Any Human Friends&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-trust.png><p>Despite the fact that Aladdin and Jasmine are brave, charming adventurers, they both never got much socialization. Aladdin had to rely on himself to survive the streets and she never got the opportunity to make friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than their animal buddies, they lived their lives alone, without companionship.</p><p>That is, until they met each other.</p><p>With Genie, Carpet, and the whole crew they brought together, their friend/family group may be a bit weird, but they finally aren't alone.</p><h2 id=aladdin-is-actually-a-prince-in-his-own-way><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Aladdin Is Actually A Prince (In His Own Way)&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-and-cassim-king-of-thieves.jpg><p>The biggest hurdle in Aladdin is the fact that Aladdin isn't a prince, so he can't marry Jasmine. What they didn't know was that he actually was a prince. Just not a conventional one.</p><p>Aladdin's true father, the one that abandoned him as a baby, was a man named Cassim. Cassim was a master thief, leading a band of excellent cutthroats and criminals. He led them so well that they named him the King of Thieves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In theory, that makes Aladdin the Prince of Thieves.</p><h2 id=the-2019-live-action-film-included-the-first-aladdin-and-jasmine-of-arabian-asian-descent><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>The 2019 Live Action Film Included The First Aladdin And Jasmine Of Arabian/Asian Descent&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aladdin-jasmine-live-action.jpg><p>In the Aladdin animated movie, Aladdin and Jasmine were voiced by famous Caucasian actors, Scott Weigner and Linda Larkin, respectively. While they did a great job, it was a missed opportunity for Arabic people to represent their own culture.</p><p>The vague origin and geographic area of theoretical Agrabah&nbsp; is complicated (it has elements of Indian and Middle Eastern culture and the folktale itself is originally Asian). However, the main cast is a mix of Egyptian, Indian, African, Iranian, and more. This mix is far closer to the culture and people Agrabah would have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, and the upcoming all-Chinese live-action Mulan, are great strides for inclusion in Hollywood.</p><p style=text-align:center>---</p><p>Were there any other wild facts about Aladdin and Jasmine that we missed?
