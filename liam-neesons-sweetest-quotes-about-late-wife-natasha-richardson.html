At the time, Richardson was married to producer <strong>Robert Fox</strong>, but her chemistry with the Northern Ireland native was undeniable to them both.</p><p>Although Richardson called the beginning of her relationship with Neeson “bad timing” since her marriage was coming to an end simultaneously, she didn’t let it affect their future.</p><p>“Obviously I fell very much in love with him,” the Cabaret star, who ended her marriage to Fox shortly after the show closed, told the <a href=#>Daily News</a> in an interview published in March 2009.</p><p>She also revealed that Neeson’s history of being a ladies’ man didn’t matter to her. “I’m pleased that women fall in love with him, because I know why,” Richardson said.</p><p>Their whirlwind romance took off after Richardson flew to Poland while Neeson was shooting Schindler’s List, following her receiving a birthday card from the actor.</p><p>Upon returning to the U.S., the pair bought a farmhouse in upstate New York and in July 1994 they tied the knot on their property. The Asylum actress surprised her groom with a <a href=#>serenade of their wedding song</a>, “Crazy Love” by <strong>Van Morrison</strong> during the festivities.</p><p>In December 1994, the newlyweds’ first joint movie, Nell, hit theaters and six months later they became parents, <a href=#>welcoming their son Micheál</a> in June 2015. Their son Daniel was born the following year.</p><p>Tragedy, however, struck in March 2009, when the British actress <a href=#>fell coming down a beginner slope</a> on Mont Tremblant while on a ski vacation in Québec, Canada, with the couple’s oldest son. She hit her head without a helmet on and was brought back to her room after reportedly turning down medical attention.</p><p>“I spoke to her and she said, ‘Oh, darling, I’ve taken a tumble in the snow.’ That’s how she described it,” Neeson recalled during a 2014 interview with <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a> for <a href=#>60 Minutes</a>.</p><p>Although she felt OK to start, the actress had <a href=#>suffered a traumatic brain injury</a> during her fall and was later taken to the hospital in Montreal. When her husband arrived, he was told that she was brain dead and on life support.</p><p>“I went in to her and told her I loved her,” the <a href=#>Love Actually</a> star explained. “[I] said, ‘Sweetie, you’re not coming back from this. You’ve banged your head. It’s — I don’t know if you can hear me, but that’s — this is what’s gone down. And we’re bringing ya back to New York. All your family and friends will come.’ And that was more or less it.”</p><p>Since her death on March 18, 2009, Neeson has <a href=#>kept himself busy</a> with work and <a href=#>kept relatively quiet about his loss</a>. When he has spoken about his love, it’s been with fondness for what they had together for 15 years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They say the hardest thing in the world is losing someone you love,” the father of two said in a <a href=#>Facebook</a> post in 2016. “My wife died unexpectedly. She brought me so much joy. She was my everything.”</p><p>Scroll down to see everything Neeson has said about his late wife and their life together before her untimely death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuaqtzGalnp2jpLu0edKwnJ6slajBbr3UqKueq12Wr7DB02ajmqyVYsSqssRmpZqskai1onnRopqhmaKZwLC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
