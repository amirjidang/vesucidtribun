“I want the world to know how I feel about him,” Linda, 56, said. “I gave that man everything. I gave him everything that I had.”
As Us Weekly previously reported, the wrestling icon, 62, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, is currently seeking $100 million in damages from Gawker, which published a video in 2012 of him having sex with the wife of his then-pal Bubba the Love Sponge."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During an appearance on <i>Inside Edition</i>, the former VH1 star tearfully revealed her true feelings about Hulk’s sex-tape trial.</p><p>“I want the world to know how I feel about him,” Linda, 56, said. “I gave that man everything. I gave him everything that I had.”</p><p>As <i>Us Weekly</i> <a href=#>previously reported</a>, the wrestling icon, 62, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, is currently seeking $100 million in damages from <i>Gawker</i>, which published a video in 2012 of him having sex with the wife of his then-pal <b>Bubba the Love Sponge</b>. He claims he was unaware that he was being recorded and is arguing that his privacy was violated.</p><p>“We are defending the First Amendment against Hulk Hogan’s effort to create a world where celebrities can promote themselves around any topic, in this case sex, and then veto how the media covers their lives,” the website<i>&nbsp;</i>responded in a statement. “This tape shows Hulk Hogan having sex with his best friend’s wife, and in fact the tape was made by his best friend Bubba who also appears in the video. Hulk Hogan bragged about his sex life for years, denied this particular sexual encounter and now thinks his own choices are worth $100 million somehow.”</p><p>Linda, who had daughter <b>Brooke</b>, 27, and son <b>Nick</b>, 25, with Hulk during their 25-year marriage doesn’t feel he deserves a dime of the $100 million he’s asking for in his suit against <i>Gawker</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“My kids to this day are still reeling, and they can’t get their feet back on planet earth,” she said. “I can’t get my life back on track either. I don’t know, what am I supposed to do? Start over now that I’m 57? I don’t know where I fit in in this world any more.”</p><p>“I was honest, I was a good wife. I never cheated on him,” Linda added. The couple filed for divorce in 2007 after Linda made allegations of physical abuse and affairs.</p><p>In an emotional letter read on <i>Inside Edition</i>, the Miami resident wrote: “YOU have single handedly ruined our 25-year marriage and our family … my trust, my love, my future, our future family with grandchildren, holidays, weddings, our kids’ lives, homes, their ability to trust, our poor animals, friends, neighbors, your career, finances, trademarks, retirement, your legacy, your reputation, your health … even your soul … You lost it ALL.”</p><p>“You took me for granted and never appreciated me or our beautiful family … blaming me for your horrendous mistakes,” she concluded. “And yet you continue in life this very way, still … Hiding behind those sunglasses, false smile, oh … and the bandana! Until you can really apologize, to me … and to our children … I will never ever forgive you.”</p><p>Watch the video above. &nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6Zrm60zqCYp2WYqrmseceonpqmXafCqrrEnWRrbV2usqK%2B0mamn2Wdlr%2BztcCgnGavYWuDeoCRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
