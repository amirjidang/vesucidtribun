I mean, I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I’m disgusted.”</p><p>“I went and sought out professional help. I’ve been going to therapy, going to rehab. Had to ask God for his mercy and grace,” he said. “I’m so sorry, but I’m committed to being a better man each and every day. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diddy is currently facing a series of serious allegations, including accusations of sexual abuse, trafficking, and other misconduct, which could potentially lead to legal consequences as the situation develops.</p><h2 id=diddy-remains-under-investigation>Diddy Remains Under Investigation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In late March, law enforcement authorities conducted raids on his properties, intercepting him while he was on his way to the airport with his daughters for a trip to the Bahamas.</p><p>In response, <a href=#>Diddy has denied all accusations</a>, with his legal team dismissing the lawsuits as baseless attempts to extort money. That is, until the video footage of him assaulting Cassie emerged, giving him no choice but to apologize (and do serious damage control) in the face of the evidence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, Diddy has not been formally charged or accused of any criminal activity by federal prosecutors at this time, although this situation could change as investigations proceed.</p><p>The raids happened only a few months after his former partner, Cassie, filed a lawsuit against him in November. Cassie accused him of assaulting her in 2018, making allegations of rape, physical abuse, and coercing her to carry a firearm for intimidation. Remarkably, her lawsuit was settled just a day after it was filed, with the settlement terms remaining confidential.</p><p>These recent allegations are part of a long-standing pattern of legal challenges that Diddy has faced, dating back to the 1990s when he founded his record label, Bad Boy Records. Multiple women have accused the billionaire of misconduct, and given that authorities are investigating, it seems they believe there’s credence to the claims.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopyUrsBuusStZLCnoqm1brDIqWSbqpGjsbR50Z6drquVYsSwvspmrqKsmGK1qrmMmpmuq5Virq24xKCYraGfo8Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
