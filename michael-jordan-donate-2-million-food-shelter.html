"NBA legend Michael Jordan is donating $2 million to help our neighbors facing hunger!"</p><p>Feeding America claims to be the largest charitable food organization in the United States. The&nbsp;charity works with 200 food banks and 60,000 food partners across the country.</p><p>They continue to encourage folks to make donations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As the pandemic continues, we are committed to ensuring everyone has the food they need during this difficult time," an excerpt from their website reads. "Feeding America is the largest charitable food assistance network working with 200 food banks and 60,000 food partners across the United States. Food bankers, volunteers, and food pantries are on the front lines to bring food where it is needed most. Since the start of the pandemic, our network has distributed an estimated 4.2 billion meals to our neighbors."</p><p>Jordan, meanwhile, has been quite generous this year. The six-time NBA champion committed $100 million to the fight against racism and inequality over the next 10 years in the wake of African American George Floyd's killing by a white police officer earlier this year.</p><p>The aforementioned show was quite successful and was the most-watched following its release. It's great to know that the proceeds will help feed the less fortunate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title='Michael Jordan & Chicago Bulls Memorabilia Items Sell Big At Auction Following "The Last Dance"' href=#>Michael Jordan & Chicago Bulls Memorabilia Items Sell Big At Auction Following "The Last Dance"</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6topZmYtaKxy2ahqKqUlrtusM6nmK2dXWd6rrXLpaCopl2bvLCwjKyfnqSkmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
