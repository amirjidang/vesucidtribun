Sadly, the pair recently broke up.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>AI’s </strong>romantic life was the center of attraction while the actor was spotted at <i>Oscars </i>alone. The main reason for their separation was due to the <i>huge age gap</i>.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, the artist claimed that <strong>Al </strong>only gifted her the flowers and pointed out that their bond was not based on expensive products.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Meital </strong>further added how to say politely that<strong> Al </strong>doesn’t prefer to spend money?&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, after the split, too, she confronted that she wanted to be friends with<strong> Al </strong>and even said it was an absolute honor to be part of a legacy.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><span class=ez-toc-section id=interesting-facts-about-his-son></span>Interesting facts about his son<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Al Pacino’s </strong>nickname was <strong>Sonny</strong>.
