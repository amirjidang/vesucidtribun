The star has since appeared in a number of other TV shows as well, but they certainly do not pay nearly as much as he made on 'Game Of Thrones'. So, just how much did Harington rake in? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things You Didn't Know About 'Game Of Thrones' Kit Harington</a></span></p><h2 id=game-of-thrones-salary>'Game Of Thrones' Salary</h2><p>Kit Harington has easily become one of the most talked-about actors in Hollywood, and it is all thanks to his role in none other than HBO's, 'Game Of Thrones'. Harington played the role of Jon Snow, who instantly turned into a fan-favorite character, and rightfully so. While the star may have had quite an unfortunate demise at the end of season 5, it seems as if it was meant to be for Snow to make his untimely return and remain part of the cast up until its end with season 8.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 8 seasons on the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Harington managed to make $500,000 per episode</a>. According to Variety, both Harington and Emilia Clarke, who played the role of&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryen, however, that doesn't seem to be on par with what others from the show were making. Sophie Turner, who played Sansa Stark, reportedly only made $175,000, which led to quite a lot of questions amongst fans. While there appears to have been some salary discrepancies, it's clear that Kit was definitely amongst the highest-paid.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kit Harington And Emilia Clarke: Facts About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>With 8 seasons and an average of 10 episodes per season, it is safe to say that Kit Harington made upward to $30 million, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with a net worth of $14 million</a>, chances are Kit was not making half a million dollars during the earlier seasons. Regardless of what his pay may have been at the start of the show, it is clear that Harington was making quite the paycheck, especially for someone who had not appeared in any major production prior to 'Game Of Thrones'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show's end in 2019, Kit found himself married and he and his wife, Rose Leslie, are expecting their first child together! Kit isn't the only 'GoT' star to have started a family, as Sophia Turner and hubby Joe Jonas, just welcomed their first child earlier this month. It is clear that Kit has skyrocketed to international fame and success, and we are all looking forward to seeing what's next for the actor.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Was Kit Harington's Life Like Before Marrying Rose Leslie?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lm57BbrTAq6Cnn6Sku265wKScZp6ipLpus8CmnGanlmLBqb7Op5ysZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
