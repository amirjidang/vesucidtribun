The Martian actor was discussing the nature of his relationship with Ben Affleck and admitted the rumors they were romantically linked "put us in a weird position of having to answer; you know what I mean?”</p><p>The <a href=#>successful Hollywood actor</a> admitted he was concerned that people questioning his sexuality would compromise his future career in the industry. Matt Damon added that the speculation about him and Ben Affleck, “was then really deeply offensive. I don’t want to, like [imply] it’s some sort of disease – then it’s like I’m throwing my friends under the bus.”</p><p>These comments came shortly after Damon had a public clash with journalist Effie Brown on HBOs Project Greenlight. He interrupted the black film producer to say, "When you’re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not the casting of the show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Effie looked shocked and disappointed with the Air actor's interruption. The hashtag #damonsplaining started trending on Twitter shortly after the actor’s controversial comments were aired. Damon was quick to defend himself, “I am sorry that they offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/matt-damon.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matt Damon Once Hired Fake Friends After He Became Famous Overnight</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After the success of 'Good Will Hunting' Matt Damon's life became surreal.

"But in terms of actors, I think you're a better actor the less people know about you period. And sexuality is a huge part of that."</p><p>Whether you're straight or gay, people shouldn't know anything about your sexuality because that's one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.</p><h2 id=matt-damon-defends-comments-about-gay-actors-after-backlash>Matt Damon Defends Comments About Gay Actors After Backlash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-A-Reality-Show-Almost-Got-Matt-Damon-Canceled-(project-greenlight).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Damon later appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show following criticism</a> he told gay actors to remain in the closet for the benefit of their careers.

Right?” he told DeGeneres.<strong> “And somebody picked it up and said I said gay actors should get back in the closet. Which is like I mean it’s stupid, but it is painful when things get said that you don’t believe.”</strong></p><p>He continued to blame the press for the controversy around his comments; “In the blogosphere there’s no real penalty for just taking the ball and running with it. You know what I mean? You’re just trying to click on your thing.

"When Ben and I first came on the scene there were rumors that we were gay because it was two guys who wrote a script together."

After Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow broke up in 2000, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her friends allegedly started spreading rumours.</a> “When I broke up with Gwyneth, somebody came to her – a friend of hers, a person I actually like – and said, ‘Well, I feel really bad telling you this, but I know people in the gay community who have slept with Ben.'"</p><p>Luckily, Ben Affleck saw the funny side of the untrue gossip and shrugged it off.

The Good Will Hunting star admitted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had to "retire," the term from his daily life</a> after his daughter told him it was inappropriate. The actor told The Sunday Times that the word “was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application.”</p><p>He said his daughter complained about him using the offensive term “months ago.” “She went to her room and wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous. I said, ‘I retire the f-slur!’ I understood,” he said in the newspaper interview. He never specifies which of his four daughters wrote the letter. This comment was met with criticism by charities and members of the LBGTQ+ community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The actor later gave a statement to Variety</a>, claiming<strong> he had never used the slur in his “personal life” and believed the interview “led many to assume the worst” about him. </strong>He clarified that he would use the slur casually and sometimes in movies until his daughter "was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was.”</p><p>Damon went on to add, “I have never called anyone ‘f****t’ in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening. I do not use slurs of any kind.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYrGiuc6nZKCZqWKupMDOq2Scp52isq%2FA0maZnqZdlrOnuMScomaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBisLC606umr52iqMZuuMabq6pn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
