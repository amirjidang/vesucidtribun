For example, Slimon, a.k.a. the Slime Monster Doughnut, is the original filled ring leader of this rag-tag crew. He is known for covering everything in his path with green slime and is an Original Glazed doughnut with lemon slime filling, dipped in spooky green icing with a green Kreme dollop. As his moniker suggests, he is also covered in “slime.”</p><p>Mumford, the Mummy Monster Doughnut, was last seen wrapping dozens boxes and coffee cups around the Krispy Kreme shops. He is an Original Glazed doughnut “wrapped” in purple ​icing. He also sports some vicious “fangs” and one eye, just like a Cyclopes.</p><p>Hypno-Henry is known as the Cake Batter Monster: A confection filled with cake batter, dipped in yellow icing and orange sanding sugar with a mesmerizing icing swirl, Hypno‑Henry hypnotizes fans into wanting more treats.</p><p>“Slimon and his cycloptic friends are looking to slime and sweeten Halloween parties throughout October,” Dave Skena, chief marketing officer for Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation, said via a press release. “We are asking everyone to keep an eye out for these mischievous monsters … and then eat them. Because they are scary good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Krispy-Kremes-Halloween-donuts.jpg><p>With the Monster Batch unleashed around the country, Krispy Kreme is offering guests a free doughnut of their choice when they wear a costume on Halloween on Thursday, October 31, to participating U.S. stores.</p><p>These spooky treats come several months after Krispy Kreme first introduced Original Filled Doughnuts as a fresh interpretation of its iconic Original Glazed confection.
