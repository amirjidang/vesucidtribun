They can be married or have a relationship and work together. Our work was all the time,” she explained. “Our marriage was 26 years. We started out working together in the band. He was part of the band, and then became my manager, later on then my husband, but it was a situation that was always business — whether we were getting ready in the morning, pillow talk, whatever, but it was business.”</p><p>“Even when we were on vacation to recharge the batteries, about three days into a vacation it was like, ‘You know what we can do?'” Reba continued.</p><p>Reba tied the knot with Blackstock, 67, back in 1989, but the couple parted ways in 2015, with Blackstock reportedly receiving a substantial $47.5 million settlement (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reba’s reported net worth is $95 million</a>). Their union bore one son, Shelby, while Narvel also has three children from a prior marriage, notably including Brandon Blackstock, who was previously married to Kelly Clarkson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-successfully-sued-her-husband-after-he-won-millions-in-their-divorce>Kelly Successfully Sued Her Husband After He Won Millions In Their Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-28-1.jpg><p>Kelly has similarly implied that Brandon was very money and business-oriented. As a talent manager himself, he helped negotiate some of her deals himself, including her successful stint on The Voice, even though Kelly has alleged Brandon once said she didn’t look good enough for television.</p><p>Clarkson's divorce from Blackstock in 2021 concluded with a significant multimillion-dollar settlement favoring Blackstock. However, recent developments in December led to a reversal of fortune for Kelly, as a court ruling <a href=#>mandated her ex to reimburse her $2.6 million</a> in commissions he allegedly withheld during their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-24t160834-424.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Joke That Got Reba McEntire Booed Of The Stage</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Reba McEntire faced several awkward moments throughout her career with the likes of Dick Clark, Keith Urban, Blake Shelton, and Miranda Lambert.</span><p>Right before the holidays, a California labor commissioner determined that Brandon owes Kelly $2,641,374 in commissions, purportedly garnered while serving as her manager. Legal documents revealed Brandon's involvement in negotiating lucrative brand deals and career opportunities for Clarkson. Despite his purportedly higher earnings from some of these deals, Brandon purportedly pocketed a booking fee.</p><p>The legal saga between Brandon and Kelly, which ensued for nearly two years following her 2020 divorce filing, involved contentious disputes over property and custody of their children. Kelly eventually secured primary custody of their kids, while Brandon received visitation rights. To settle the divorce, the American Idol star agreed to a one-time payment of $1.3 million to Brandon and committed to paying him $115,000 monthly in spousal support until January 2024, which Kelly just stopped paying months ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpqRYrqksc2toKudXZmyp7HNnapmo5Whubp5wqWYq6OjpLu0ecKlmKKlo2Kvs63NnaanZZKhrqS30q2mnKNdlrO1sdFmpJ6ro656pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
