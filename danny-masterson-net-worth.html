He rose to prominence in the mid-1990s with his role as Steven Hyde in the sitcom That ’70s Show.&nbsp;</p><p>After the show ended in 2006, Danny Masterson had guest-starring roles on How I Met Your Mother and Men at Work. He also starred in the 2014 Netflix original series The Ranch.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=#>Danny Masterson was arrested</a> and charged with raping three women. If convicted, he faces up to 45 years in prison.</p><p>Despite the charges, Danny Masterson’s net worth remains unchanged.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>House & Property</h2><p>A house on Holly Mont Drive in Los Angeles was reportedly up for sale by Danny in 2007 for $1.595 million. The four-bedroom house has a private pool, a multi-terraced yard, a hot tub, a marble and gold leaf fireplace, and a two-car garage.</p><p>He had paid $560,000 for the house when he first bought it in 1998, shortly after getting his lucrative role on “<strong>That ’70s Show</strong>.”</p><p>Masterson had already made investments in a number of <a href=#>real estate</a> properties by this time, including six apartments and a few smaller apartment complexes.&nbsp;</p><p>After purchasing an apartment in Los Angeles in 2003, Danny sold it to Laura Prepon for $165,000 less than a year later.</p><p>Reports in 2020 claimed that there was an odd connection between Masterson’s Hollywood Hills residence and his continuing rape-related legal matter.&nbsp;</p><p>He was renting out his home on Hollyridge Drive and living in a residence in Santa Ynez, Santa Barbara County, at this time. In 2007, he paid $2.995 million for this 4,323-square-foot house (formerly owned by Chuck Berry).</p><p>Danny posted a $3.3 million bond to get out after being detained in June 2020 on rape charges. He put the bond on the Hollyridge Drive house.</p><p>When Masterson was getting his house financed, he filed a variety of lawsuits alleging that the Bank of New York Mellon and the Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems (MERS) submitted false documents.&nbsp;</p><p>Danny claimed that as a result of his activities, he was no longer required to make mortgage payments. These requests have repeatedly been denied, and one lawyer said: “Plaintiffs appear to be merely throwing arguments against the wall in the hope that they might come up with some justification for canceling their mortgage loan without full payback.“</p><p>It appears that Masterson personally filed several of these lawsuits in an effort to defend his property against legal action.</p><p>Danny ultimately sold this house in December 2021 for $6.2 million after initially offering it for $7 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>His career helped him amass wealth</strong></h2><p>Danny Masterson’s career has been marked by ups and downs. After starting out in the early 1990s with a series of supporting roles, he achieved success with his starring role in the popular sitcom That ’70s Show.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his subsequent film roles were largely unsuccessful, and he struggled to find work in the early 2000s. In recent years, Masterson has experienced a career resurgence, thanks to his starring role in the Netflix series The Ranch.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also returned to his comedic roots, appearing in a number of films and television shows. As Masterson continues to work steadily, it seems clear that his long-term prospects in Hollywood are strong.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwwKelsmWdlsC1sdGspqdlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
