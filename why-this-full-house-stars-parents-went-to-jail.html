However, behind the scenes, the actress’s life was hardly that of a wholesome, average family sitcom. One example of the drama that plagued the life of Sweetin was the incarceration of her parents. This list will explore the reason as to why Sweetin's parents went to jail, along with taking a brief glance at her life, career, and the show that made her a star.</p><h2 id=what-was-lsquo-full-house-rsquo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Was ‘Full House’?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Full House </strong>was one of the many sitcoms plastered all over TV screens in the late 80s and early 90s. With all its good nature, and corny presentation, the “G-rated dysfunctional family” (as Joey Gladstone himself, Dave Coulier has stated in the past) carved a niche out for itself, introducing us to a widower being aided by his brother in law and his best friend, trying to raise his three daughters. The show was a consistent hit until 1995 when the series came to an end. Full House gave us the Olsen twins, wacky antics, and the phrase, “you got it, dude,” for better or for worse.</p><h2 id=who-was-jodie-before-she-became-the-most-famous-middle-child-on-tv><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Was Jodie Before She Became The Most Famous Middle Child On TV?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jodie Sweetin</strong> was born in<strong> Los Angeles, in 1982</strong>. Adopted at 9 months old, due to her parents being incarcerated at the time (more on that later, of course) by her uncle, Sweetin spoke about her feelings upon discovering she was adopted in an interview with Allison Kugel, “in a very self-torturous way" and at one point, thought, "Oh, something was wrong with me." She further explained "I think we all kind of take that on a little bit. But I’ve completely changed how I view myself.” After studying ballet, Sweetin would guest star on the sitcom Valerie before landing the role of Stephanie Tanner on Full House.</p><h2 id=the-show-made-jodie-sweetin-a-recognizable-face><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Show Made Jodie Sweetin A Recognizable Face</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The success of Full House made<strong> Jodie Sweetin</strong> a<strong> very familiar face </strong>(<a href=#>regardless of whether Sweetin enjoyed her time on the show or not</a>.) Achieving stardom at an early age, Sweetin would keep audiences charmed and laughing as the sarcastic, somewhat annoying middle sister Stephanie Tanner. Though Sweetin would go on to appear in other projects, it was her role on Full House she is most remembered for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Pics Fuller House Producers Don't Want Us To See Of Jodie Sweetin</a></span></p><h2 id=jodie-sweetin-had-some-major-difficulties-after-the-show-ended><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jodie Sweetin Had Some Major Difficulties After The Show Ended</span></h2><p>Sweetin experienced some major hardship after Full House,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>becoming addicted to both alcohol and other heavy drugs such as crack and methamphetamine</strong></a>.

Sweetin has stated that her father was<strong> killed in a prison riot </strong>and her <strong>mother was a drug abuser, </strong>but whatever it was that landed the pair in prison remains a mystery. "I would hear stories about my mom leaving me to go off and party. And for years I was like, 'F**k her. How could somebody do that to their kid?' When I started seeing my own addiction getting in the way of being a mom, I finally understood: If you're not in the right place to get sober, you're not ready to be a mom," is what Sweetin said, according to Usmagazine.com.</p><h2 id=does-jodie-sweetin-have-a-relationship-with-her-parents-today><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Does Jodie Sweetin Have A Relationship With Her Parents Today?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sweetin </strong>has stated in interviews that she has <strong>never connected</strong> with her biological parents. According to Today.com, Sweetin had this to say about her parents, “As far as I know, they’re not alive, and I’m totally OK with that.” Sweetin further added, “There’s this point in your life where you finally kind of realize what happened. That it no longer becomes something about you, that it’s like, ‘Oh, I wasn’t wanted,’” she continued, “It was like, ‘No, they actually made the healthiest decision for me by allowing me to be adopted by another family that could provide better.’”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> This 'Full House' Star Is Becoming One Of The 'Worst Cooks In America'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWqv4yfrKWkXZ28tr%2FEZqqtmaKoerGt0Z6lratdrLKvwIytpmaikZ65cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
