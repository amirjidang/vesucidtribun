That’s right, Lunar New Year is here, which means if our “new year, new me” plans didn’t quite work out in January, we have a chance to start again. So why not start the year off right with some gorgeous <a href=# data-gift=1>gifts</a> from Coach?</p><p><strong>Lunar New Year Callie Foldover Chain Clutch With Floral Bow Print</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Callie-Clutch.jpg><p>This beautiful red clutch has Coach’s signature polished pebbled leather detailed with a floral bow motif. Red symbolizes good luck, and we feel lucky to have found this bag. With a detachable golden chain strap, this clutch also doubles as a cross-body! It has eight credit card slots, a full-length bill compartment, an inside zip pocket, an outside pocket and snap closure. Whew! This little bag packs a powerful punch and we need it as a statement piece.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Lunar New Year Callie Foldover Chain Clutch With Floral Bow Print</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$295</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 7 Plus/8 Plus Folio</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-iPhone-Folio.jpg><p>Who else drops their phone all the time, no matter how hard they try not to? We could throw our phone into a pile of pillows and it would still somehow find its way to the ground. With this leather folio, we can finally be at ease when we inevitably drop our phones, because it will keep our phone more protected than a case or screen protector ever could. There is an attached case to keep our phone in place, three credit card slots and an open pocket, making this a great substitute for a wallet when we’re trying to travel light! Just pick one of the four colors available, snap it closed and go!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>iPhone 7 Plus/8 Plus Folio</a>&nbsp;for <a href=# rel=noopener>$95</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>Beveled Edge Oval Sunglasses</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Oval-Sunglasses.jpg><p>Our future is looking so bright this year that we absolutely are going to need these two-tone effect sunglasses. The gradient lenses offer 100% UV protection, and the oval shape is both unique and flattering. We love these for all seasons. They come in three colors, and we’re definitely feeling the Berry for this Lunar New Year.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Beveled Edge Oval Sunglasses</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$165</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>Parker In Colorblock Signature Canvas</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Parker-Black.jpg><p>The Parker is an updated version of the Coach bag. The canvas is detailed with the brand’s iconic “C” logo, but the details don’t end there. A beautiful Tea Rose Turnlock closure holds down a refined leather flap, which can be opened to reveal a fabric lining and multiple interior pockets. A golden leather-chain strap laces through the flap for cross-body wear, but we can double it up for shoulder wear too! We can choose our favorite out of four shades — and don’t forget to add a monogram at no extra cost!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Parker In Colorblock Signature Canvas</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$350</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>Lunar New Year Silk Square Scarf With Pig Motif</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Pig-Scarf.jpg><p>Bandanas aren’t just for cowboys anymore! This lightweight, 100% silk scarf brings NYC to the wild west, while the deep red color brings us good fortune for the Year of the Pig. A retro-style pig motif graces the center of this scarf, which looks gorgeous around our neck, tied to our bag or wrapped around our wrist!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Lunar New Year Silk Square Scarf With Pig Motif</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$95</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>Daisy Rivet Hinged Bangle</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Daisy-Bangle.jpg><p>What goes best with the auspicious color of red? Gold and silver, of course! We love to mix metals, and with a bangle like this, we don’t see how anyone couldn’t. Floral rivets line this polished bracelet, the center of each flower with a contrasting metal. This eye-catching effect is both playful and chic, so why not double it up by getting two and stacking them up? The more bangles, the better!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daisy Rivet Hinged Bangle</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$145</a> from Coach!</strong></p><p><strong>Skinny Wallet</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Coach-Skinny-Wallet.jpg><p>This thin leather wallet comes in eight colors. Eight! The mixing and matching possibilities are vast for pairing this with our favorite bags. This wallet has 15 credit card slots, which we’ll also be using for our endless supply of rewards cards. There’s also a convenient ID window, as well as a zip coin pocket and three full-length bill compartments for maximum organization. No more digging around for crinkled-up bills! We can also keep our phones in this wallet, making it the ultimate companion for the year and beyond.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Skinny Wallet</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$150</a> from Coach!
