Yes, Ob is one of the languages that kids learn so they can communicate in privacy without having "adults and parents" who are around understand.&nbsp;It is always a delight to be able to speak another language, even if it is not an official one.</p><p>Some kids actually invent their own languages with their siblings, while others use one of the many&nbsp;childhood languages we came across&nbsp;for English-speaking countries alone. There may be others that have not been documented, however, the language list below will give you hours of fun, especially if you have kids or want the capability to have a private conversation with a couple of friends.</p><p>It might surprise you to note that&nbsp;there are almost 100 childhood languages that are documented in Wikipedia alone. Non-English speaking countries have their own languages, particularly in&nbsp;Spain, Sweden, Greece and France. Most of these countries have several, while most of the others have more than one. In fact,&nbsp;if you are Hungarian, you have a choice between Madárnyelv, Kongarian and Verzin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of the artificial&nbsp;languages in any country are&nbsp;not&nbsp;enormously complicated, unless you don't speak the language at all. For example, if you are a natural&nbsp;Hungarian speaker and you want to speak Kongarian, all you need to do is add "ko" before each syllable, e.g., latok becomes largatorgok!&nbsp;Most childhood languages around the globe use similar rules. After all, the idea is to be able to speak a language without knowing grammatical or spelling rules. In a very short time, you could be fluent.</p><p>Check out the 12 childhood languages used in English-speaking countries alone, and see which ones you can master on the spot. Gob-ood lob-uck!</p><h2 id=12-uasi><strong>12. Uasi</strong></h2><p>via;bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is one of the most difficult childhood languages to master. It almost sounds like a language an Aboriginal tribe might speak. Here are the basic rules behind constructing words and sentences as you go. The vowels in each word have to be shifted to the next one. For example an "a" becomes an "e", "e" becomes an "i", etc.. Getting this part of Uasi means you are close to getting the whole artificial language. But your brain has to work quickly to master it, or even construct a sentence. Roght?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-tutnese><strong>11.&nbsp;Tutnese</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Tutnese is considered a language game and is sometimes referred to as Double Dutch. It is one of the more difficult artificial languages as it requires some memorization. When speaking Tutnese, you will pronounce the vowels normally, but then the first consonant of each syllable is exchanged with a syllable from a list of 21 possible consonant syllables, such as "tut", "gug", "yub" or "mum". &nbsp;There is a Tutnese syllable for every consonant, which is exactly what requires memorization. So if the consonant begins with a "y", then you would use "yub" in its place. Gugot it?</p><p></p><h2 id=10-pig-latin><strong>10. Pig Latin</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Possibly the most well known of all U.S. childhood languages is Pig Latin, which is simple if you know the rules. All you have to do is move the beginning of the word to the end and add "ay". For example, if you wanted to say, "Want to have a drink?", you would simply say, "Ant-way to ave-hay a ink-dray?" Women will swoon when you speak this sexy artificial dialect.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-aigy-paigy-aka-haigy-paigy><strong>9. Aigy Paigy (aka Haigy Paigy)</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aigy Paigy is fairly easy to comprehend, if you are accustomed to the standard rules&nbsp;of all of these languages. It is all about substitution - you just have to know what to substitute, where and how. In this language all you need to do is follow the consonant of each syllable with "aig" or "haig". Example: "Hello girl!", you would say, "Haig-elaig-o gaig-irl!"</p><p></p><h2 id=8-obby-dobby-aka-ob><strong>8. Obby Dobby&nbsp;(aka Ob)</strong></h2><p>via;bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is the language used at the beginning of this article and one of our personal favorites. It is easy once you get the hang of it. It is another consonant and syllable combination. The biggest difference is that you also work with the vowels. For example, if you want to say a word that begins with a vowel, the use the "ob" before the word. The word "and" would become "ob-and". However, when reciting a word that starts with a consonant, you will put the "ob" after the first consonant of each syllable. Thob-is ob-is lob-ots ob-of fob-un! (Translation: This is lots of fun!)</p><p></p><h2 id=7-jaredian><strong>7. Jaredian</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jaredian is hilarious and a bit complicated. The basic rule is that each word gets reversed. If writing it, you would also replace some of the letters with letters of the Cyrillic language, which adds a whole new level of complexity. In&nbsp;thinking about speaking it, we wish you good luck, as it is not easy to reverse every word in a sentence on the fly. So this language will take much longer to master. Thgir?</p><p></p><h2 id=6-cockney-rhyming-slang><strong>6. Cockney Rhyming Slang</strong></h2><p>via;bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is&nbsp;very popular in the UK and, in fact, was supposedly developed in the East End of London. Rhyming slang also became popular as slang in Australia, over the years. Here is how is works: replace the first word of the phrase with one that rhymes with that word. Whew. Not easy. It's much more simple&nbsp;when you know the more common expressions that are shortened. For example: Adam and Eve rhymes with "believe", so you might say, "can you Adam and Eve it?" Again - it pays to be in the know.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-gibberish><strong>5. Gibberish</strong></h2><p>via;bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This language has a few hard and fast rules, such as inserting "itherg" for words that are less than three letters. Also, words that are spelled within four to six letters must have "itug" inserted. Lastly, for words that are longer than seven letters, "idig" is inserted. The insertions always come after the first consonant of each syllable. Example: Hitherg-ow nitherg-ow britug-own citherg-ow? (Translation: How now brown cow?)</p><p></p><h2 id=4-inflationary-english><strong>4. Inflationary English</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This one is a bit silly, as it would take a while for anyone to catch on. It may actually confuse everyone, instead of initiating privacy. Here is how it works: Whenever a number is spoken within a word, change that part of the word to the next number. Like this: Is sometwo up five elevennis? (Translation: Is someone up for tennis?)</p><p></p><h2 id=3-izzle><strong>3. Izzle</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This language can be mastered quickly as the rules are simple. It is often considered a gangster language as it doesn't require a great deal of brain power. If that seems like a general statement, it is. Not all gangsters take the time to master this one. All you have to do is insert "izzle" after just about anything, although the rule states that it is placed after each word's pre-vowel consonant and ditching the rest of the word. &nbsp;Do you undershizzle?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-back-slang><strong>2. Back Slang</strong></h2><p>via;bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This language is said to have been initiated by butchers in Australia, so they could speak about their products without the customers knowing what was being said. Anagrams and speaking words in reverse is the primary method behind this language. Speaking backwards is never easy, however, if you're in the meat market perhaps the language has a finite amount of words that are mostly memorized.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-spoonerism><strong>1. Spoonerism</strong></h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Spoonerism is amusing to speak and to listen to, however, it may not fool everyone around. What happens is an exchange&nbsp;between the first letter of two or more words in the sentence. For example, if you wanted to say, "I want to drink a beer", you would say, "I want to bink a dreer." Another example, "I love my woman," might come out as, "I wove my loman."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqal2ks27Ax55kpqejqXq2utSsrJqkXaiypL7ErWSlmZ6cwqKzxKxkqJ5dmLWquMOrnKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
