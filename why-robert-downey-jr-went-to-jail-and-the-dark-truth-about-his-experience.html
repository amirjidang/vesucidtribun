However, there is something that a lot of people forgot, just like Tony Stark is imprisoned during the first part of the movie, Downey Jr. spent time behind bars. On top of the fact that a lot of people forget that Downey Jr. went to prison, the dark truth of his experience is rarely discussed.<strong>Updated on January 9th, 2023 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>It is remarkable how Robert Downey Jr. was able to handle his past and move on from the trauma. The actor was addicted to drugs for the entirety of his young life after being introduced to drugs at the age of six. Downey Jr. was in and out of rehab until finally getting clean in 2003. That troubling time in his life also included a complicated relationship with his father. Robert Downey Sr. was the one to introduce drugs to Downey Jr., and the two used to bond by doing drugs together. Downey Sr. passed away in July 2021, and thankfully Downey Jr. was able to repair his relationship with his father before his passing. Downey Jr. honors his father in a new documentary movie on Netflix titled Sr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-robert-downey-jr-went-to-prison>Why Robert Downey Jr. Went To Prison</h2><p>According to all sources, Robert Donwey Jr. has been completely sober since 2003 and he shows no outward signs that he is in danger of a relapse. Given the fact that overcoming addiction is a daily battle, Downey Jr.’s sobriety is a truly incredible achievement. After all, at the height of his addiction, Downey Jr. was in a really bad place and wound up behind bars because of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Lesser-Known Facts About Robert Downey Jr.'s Life We Bet You Didn't Know</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1996 until 2001, Robert Downey Jr. was arrested numerous times on an array of charges that all related to his substance abuse issues. After Downey Jr.’s arrests began to stack up and he missed court-ordered illegal substance tests, Robert was sentenced to time behind bars. Like <a href=#>other stars who have done time</a>, Downey Jr. was ultimately sentenced to three years in prison. After spending almost a year behind bars, Downey Jr. was given an early release.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-on-his-time-in-prison>Robert Downey Jr. On His Time In Prison</h2><p>In the years since Robert Downey Jr. was released from prison, he has become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. With that in mind, it makes sense that Downey Jr. has mostly sought to put the darkest time in his life behind him. Despite that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downey Jr. has been willing to discuss his time in prison</a> in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the year 2000, Robert Downey Jr. spoke to Vanity Fair about what he went through as he tried to accept the truth that he was going to spend a lot of time behind bars. “A symptom that characterizes the first phase is shock. Under certain conditions, shock may even precede the prisoner’s formal admission into the camp. The main symptom of the second phase is apathy, a necessary mechanism of self-defense.” During the same interview, Downey Jr. explained that he had to quickly learn the “rules”. “You know, it’s all about sinks and toilet rims. Because that’s what it comes down to. I was new to the cell, so it wasn’t really my sink. I was just a sink guest.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>11 Stars We Forget Did Time In Prison</a></span></p><p>Amazingly enough, when Robert Downey Jr. spoke to Rolling Stone in 2010, he revealed that his addictions were so bad that being in prison left him feeling secure. The reason for that is that when he was behind bars, Downey Jr. felt safe from his addictions which he referred to as “intruders”. “When the door clicks shut, then you are safe. There is nothing aside from a rogue correctional officer that can do you harm if you have the right cellie. You are actually in the safest place on Earth. Safe from the intruders.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it is no secret that people can find illegal substances in prison, but as Downey Jr. explained to Rolling Stone, he knew that would put him in danger of violence. “If you follow those impulses, you are going to be very indebted to someone who is too much of a public-safety threat to even just be in jail.”</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-is-ldquo-grateful-rdquo-his-son-was-arrested>Robert Downey Jr. Is “Grateful” His Son Was Arrested</h2><p>Of course, there are far too many examples of people whose lives have been decimated by the scourge of addiction. On the bright side, however, Robert Downey Jr. has certainly proven that addicts can turn their lives around in a massive way. Once Downey Jr. got clean, however, his family continued to be affected by the damage that illegal substances can do. The reason for that is that in 2014, Downey Jr.’s son Indio was arrested for illegal substance possession.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of being devastated by his son Indio Downey’s arrest, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr. put out a statement claiming to be “grateful”</a>. "We're grateful to the Sheriff's Department for their intervention and believe Indio can be another recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale." After posting bail for his son, Downey Jr. checked Indio into rehab and he hasn’t gotten into any publicly known legal problems since then.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-discusses-healing-in-netflix-s-sr>Robert Downey Jr. Discusses Healing In Netflix's Sr.</h2><p>With the passing of Robert Downey Sr. in 2021, Robert Downey Jr. put together a documentary film with Netflix to honor his father. The film Sr. discusses life, addiction, and the healing process that comes after severe trauma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Downey Sr. and Downey Jr. had a very complicated relationship. Downey Sr. introduced the Marvel actor to drugs when he was only 6 years old. As Downey Jr. grew up, he used to do drugs with his father on a regular basis. After getting clean, Downey Jr. was able to heal his relationship with his father and move forward with his life.</p><p>Sr. is now streaming on Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdp7yjsdGtZJ2np6OyunnJq2SwnZ6perW7jKOYoqRdlruledOhnGackae4bsDRrquhZZGXvLbAjKGgrGWVrb2mvsiepZydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
