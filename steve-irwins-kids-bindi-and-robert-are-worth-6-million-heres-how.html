The worst affected was Irwin’s wife, Terri, and their kids, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bindi and Robert</a>. At the time of the death of the superbly famous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian wildlife expert</a> and television personality, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bindi</a> was eight years old, and Robert was 2. However, it soon became apparent that Steve’s family was keen on keeping the legacy alive. Terri, Bindi, and Robert have all contributed in unison towards that cause. They both made appearances on Steve’s television shows and even in public demonstrations with crocodiles on-site at the family-owned Australia Zoo. No wonder they have grown up in the public eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bindi-irwin>Bindi Irwin</h2><p>Having hosted her first wildlife TV series, Bindi The Jungle Girl, at the age of just eight, she has also starred in the 2010 movie Free Willy: Escape from Pirate’s Cove, and hosted the Australian game show Bindi’s Bootcamp, centered around the theme of wildlife in 2012. She has also released several albums with her band Bindi and the Jungle Girls. In 2015, Bindi won the twenty-first season of Dancing With The Stars along with dancing partner Derek Hough. Interestingly, she had to receive special permission from a California judge to compete as a minor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bindi Irwin Cuddles Kangaroo</a></span></p><p>Eventually, she got engaged to her long-time boyfriend Chandler Powell; what’s more, she revealed in an Instagram post that Powell popped the note at Australia Zoo, and brother Robert captured the happy event in pictures. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon last year, Robert revealed that he would be the one to walk Bindi down the aisle. Her return to American TV, after a period of going under the radar, was on Celebrity Family Feud, where she, alongside her mom and brother, competed against actress Chrissy Metz and her relatives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bindi Irwin Is Getting Married This Year...

Reportedly, Terri and Steve have a net worth of $10 million, just in case you wanted to know.</p><p>Since 2018, Bindi and Robert, accompanied by their mother, have been hosting the Animal Planet show Crikey! It’s the Irwins, which is targeted at continuing Steve’s mission of bringing people closer to animals alive. Their dad must be immensely proud of them, and the conservation efforts they are putting in. We can also learn a thing or two from how close-knit the family has managed to remain over the years, despite Steve’s death.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmen Electra Is Worth $16 Million...
