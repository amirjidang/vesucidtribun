For the longest time, he was known to harass guests with intimate questions just to entertain his listeners. When his first wife Alison Berns asked him for a divorce, after 21 years of marriage, he realized that his narcissism and focus on his career had ruined his marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was time for a change. Stern decided to go for therapy to improve himself as well as his communication skills. The new Howard Stern is far different than when he came to fame. He credits his longevity on the radio to that big change he did in his life. Aside from radio, Stern has taken on other roles that have enabled him to amass his wealth over the years. Now he readily brings home the bacon and this is how he has maintained his $650 million net worth.</p><h2 id=radio><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Radio</strong></span></h2><p>Other than money, Stern longed for the freedom to do and say whatever he wanted on radio. This is what led him to start The Howard Stern Show, which airs to date. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money,</a> in order to air uncensored content, Stern decided to move from regular airwaves to satellite radio under the mega-entertainment audio company, SiriusXM. He opened two channels, which were a massive success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though he has reduced the number of hours he works per week, radio has been his biggest moneymaker and continues to be. He has maintained a lot of his wealth by doing it.</p><h2 id=producing-shows><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Producing Shows</strong></span></h2><p>Other than radio, Stern picked up other roles that have helped him maintain his huge net worth to date. He started hosting a late-night TV show called The Howard Stern Radio Show, which ran for three seasons. After the show, Stern decided to work as an executive producer through his production company for several TV and film projects, his most successful show being Son of the Beach as City-Journal reports.</p><h2 id=shares-with-networks><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Shares With Networks</strong></span></h2><p>When Stern first broadcasted his show on Sirius, he received 34.3 million of Sirius stock worth $218 million for surpassing his contractual requirements. He later received another bonus of 22 million shares of stock worth $82.9 million. A year later, Sirius decided to merge with a rival station and paid Stern $25 million as per a clause in his contract as wiki reports. All these shares and money is what has enabled him to maintain his net worth up to today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=being-a-best-selling-author><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Being A Best-Selling Author</strong></span></h2><p>Stern released his first book, 'Private Parts' in 1993 and his second book, 'Miss America' in 1995. He entered the New York Best Seller list selling over one million copies. Three years later, his first book was adapted into a film, which he starred in. Since he was the scriptwriter and the main cast, he must have made a chunk considering it grossed at $41.2 million at the Box Office as Wiki reveals. Following the success of his two books, Stern recently released his third book Howard Stern Comes Again in 2019.</p><h2 id=serving-as-a-judge-on-agt><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Serving As A Judge On AGT</strong></span></h2><p>Stern was offered the opportunity to replace Judge Piers Morgan on the hit show America’s Got Talent from 2012 to 2015. He earned a salary of $15 million per year as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet</a> reports. When he joined, the show relocated to Radio City Music Hall in NYC to cater to his crazy radio show schedule but after three years, he could not balance the two and decided not to film AGT anymore. At least that salary has helped him maintain his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=being-in-long-lasting-marriages><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Being In Long-Lasting Marriages</strong></span></h2><p>In Hollywood, it is easy for celebrities to lose their hard-earned money through failed marriages, especially those without prenuptial agreements. Stern has been able to maintain his money by having long-lasting marriages. According to Moneyinc, he was married to his first wife Alison Berns for 21 years and is currently married to his second wife Beth Ostrosky since 2008.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Things We Just Learned About Howard Stern's Radio Show</a></span></p><h2 id=photography><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Photography</strong></span></h2><p>Photography is another small side hustle that has helped Stern maintain his wealth.

Because of his fame, he still does special appearances where he gets paid, like on The Ellen Show and Jimmy Fallon Show. It might not be a chunk but at least it helps him maintain his net worth.

Luckily, he stopped when he did. According to Wiki, in 2012, he even started a pescetarian diet to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p><h2 id=his-big-change><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>His Big Change</strong></span></h2><p>For the longest time, Stern was known for his antagonistic celebrity interviews until he decided to change.

According to Yahoo, Stern believes he would not be making millions on radio to date were it not for his big change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Celebs Howard Stern Will Never Get Along With</a></span></p><h2 id=consistency-and-a-good-reputation><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Consistency And A Good Reputation</strong></span></h2><p>Stern has not always had a good reputation thanks to those outrageous online antics he did in the past. After he realized what he was doing was hurting people and his reputation, he decided to change. Another thing that has enabled him to maintain his net worth is consistency.

To improve his communication further, he mastered the art of being able to elicit honest emotions and genuine insight rather than being hostile to the guests. This greatly improved his communication making him the highest-paid radio host to date. This skill has definitely helped him maintain his wealth over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=painter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Painter</strong></span></h2><p>Stern is truly a jerk of all trades.
