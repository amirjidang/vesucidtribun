He wrote a really nice apology, which I appreciated very much,” she said. “He and I worked together for so many years, for a long time, and I only wish him the best moving forward.”</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>Bush broke his silence on the scandal</a> in a <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> interview published on Sunday, May 21. “I am not grateful for the moment,” he said. “But I’m grateful for what I’ve gotten out of it. I’m grateful that it hit me all the way to my core.”</p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=1316 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/billy-bush-the-hollywood-reporter-cover-zoom-71a94c06-be56-448e-a8f3-8659714b4fd6.jpg alt="Billy Bush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Bush, who was fired from the <i>Today </i>show over the incident, added that the fallout was worse than he expected. “I thought that we would work through it and we would address people. I put together an apology right away, the one you saw; I told people that I was ashamed and embarrassed. And I was. So in the beginning, I thought, ‘OK, we’ll go and own up to this moment,” he said. “Then I got home, and it started to become apparent that [I] would not be returning [to the <i>Today</i> show]. It hurt a lot, and I fell apart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The TV personality also <a href=#>told <i>Good Morning America</i>’s <b>Robin Roberts</b> that the tape brought his daughter, Mary, to tears</a>. “My now 16-year-old daughter called me and she was in tears. She was really upset,” he said. “I said, ‘Mary, it’s going to be OK. You know, don’t worry.’ And she said, ‘No, why were you laughing at the things that he was saying on that bus? Why were you playing along with that, dad? It wasn’t funny.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZyhxm6u1KyfZp2dlratscNmpZqmk656sLDEpaNmmZ5irrG7y6iesmWRm8GmvoylnJqjlZl6ta3PnmSwbGhohHaFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
