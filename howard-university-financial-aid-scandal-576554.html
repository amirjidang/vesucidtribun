The goal established at the onset of this investigation was to conduct it in a confidential manner that ensured a thorough examination of the issues without jeopardizing the integrity of the findings. However, that does not mitigate the sense of mistrust that many students and members of our community feel right now. We understand that and we hear you.”</p><p>An internal investigation into a now-deleted Medium post discovered that six employees attending classes at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">historically-black</a> educational institution received tuition benefits as well as university grants, resulting in receiving more money than the cost of tuition at the school.</p><p>President Frederick noted that he is working with outside experts to “assist in exploring all options to recoup the funds.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Social media</a> caught wind of senior Tyrone Hankerson, a student employee who is at the center of the controversy. It is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">reported</a> that he scammed nearly half-a-million dollars from the university. President Frederick appears to address Hankerson in his address.</p><p>“Further, I want to make clear that students who also work at the University do so under the supervision of University employees, who are ultimately responsible for their activities,” he continued. “Most Howard employees are responsible citizens and serve the University well, so I want to also acknowledge their efforts.&nbsp; Any exceptions to this rule, however, will continue to be aggressively addressed.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Please review the following statement from President Frederick regarding University Grants <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://t.co/o6dkT1r1VZ</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pic.twitter.com/hftlxLsWMk</a></p><p>— <a href=# id=auto-tag_howard-university_1 data-tag=howard-university>Howard University</a> (@HowardU) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">March 28, 2018</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Please refer to the latest statement from President Frederick to students.
