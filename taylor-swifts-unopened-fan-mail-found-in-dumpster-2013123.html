The 23-year-old Grammy winner receives countless pieces of fan mail each week from around the world — but over the weekend, a huge stockpile of said mail was discovered, unopened, laying in a dumpster in Swift's hometown of Nashville, Tenn. Local Kaylee Francescan discovered the motherlode of ignored letters "covered with pictures, hearts and sparkles" while throwing out the trash.</p><p>"There were like hundreds of letters in there to Taylor Swift and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh!' I didn't know if they were stolen [or] discarded, so I threw them in a box," Francescan told ABC Nashville station <a href=#>WKRN</a>. "And I'm like, 'Somebody needs to let Taylor know,' It did bother me [because] I know how much her fans mean to her."</p><p>The fan mail is typically sent to a P.O. Box at a Nashville strip mall, with a member of the chart-topper's team fetching the mail regularly. Thankfully, it was simply a clerical error, Swift's rep tells <a href=#>Us Weekly.</a></p><p>"A small batch of mail that was supposed to be delivered to Taylor was accidentally put with letters headed for the recycling center," the rep explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, Swift's gratitude towards her fans is well known. "It blows me away how thoughtful and organized they are," Swift has said. "Sometimes they'll give me a scrapbook or a project that was made by hundreds of fans from around the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYsKvu8%2BepZ6cXZuur3nMmqClZZakwq%2BwjKKlZpylor20wMSrZGtoYWh%2Bc3%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
