Alongside Sia and Jessie J., most of these stars had a career in writing before they became superstars themselves. These are ten singers who wrote songs for other stars before they were famous.</p><h2 id=bebe-rexha-the-monster><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Bebe Rexha – "The Monster"</span></h2><p>Before<a href=#> Bebe Rexha</a> made it big in the music world singing her own songs, she was writing hit songs for other artists. One song that she's responsible for seems like it's a&nbsp;bit unlikely for Bebe, however, she wrote it when she was in a very dark place herself:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Monster" </a>by <a href=#>Eminem</a> featuring <a href=#>Rihanna</a>. Bebe had been going through some bad times — she had just been dropped from her record label and her own career was at a standstill; she wasn't the Bebe Rexha we know today. Putting her feelings into words, "The Monster" was born. Eminem wrote verses to go with her hook, and the song as we know it was created.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ne-yo-irreplaceable><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ne-Yo – "Irreplaceable"</span></h2><p>We all know that <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> has quite a few iconic songs, but even the Queen B needs a little help when it comes to songwriting some of her best songs, one of them being her hit track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Irreplaceable."</a> But what you might not realize is that there was another famous face that was behind the writing for this song. That famous face was none other than <a href=#>Ne-Yo</a>. The singer was the hand behind the pen on a number of songs, Beyoncé's being one of his most famous.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran-little-things><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ed Sheeran – "Little Things"</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> was a household name himself, he was writing hit songs for many other people. Ed Sheeran was the mastermind behind <a href=#>One Direction's</a> hit song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Little Things."</a> The track features adorable lyrics that all 1D fans know and love. There's a lot of history behind the song, as Ed wrote the song when he was just 17 years old way before his was the big name that he is today. He found the song again a few years later, and decided that he wanted to send it to the One Direction boys, and it was an instant hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-michaels-sorry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Julia Michaels – "Sorry"</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#>Julia Michaels</a> stepped out into the music scene as a solo artist, she was the person writing some of your favorite songs for other artists. One of Julia's most popular songs that she's ever written for another artist is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Sorry"</a> by <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Of Niall Horan’s Best Songs (According To YouTube Views)</a></span></p><p>Julia admittedly didn't think her song would get on Justin's album when she sent him her songs, but she was so excited when she found out it was chosen. The song is one of her most successful ones, as it spent 42 weeks on the Hot 100. Julia has also written for Fifth Harmony, Selena Gomez, and even Britney Spears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sia-diamonds><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sia – "Diamonds"</span></h2><p>It's been quite a long time&nbsp;since&nbsp;<a href=#>Rihanna</a> has released any new music, but we can always look back and reminisce on some of her older hits. One of Rihanna's most popular songs is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Diamonds."</a> The hit track was actually written by fellow famed singer, <a href=#>Sia</a>. The song apparently came to Sia very quickly, and the track was written in a matter of minutes. When Rihanna heard Sia sing her demo version of the song, she immediately loved the way she sang it, and followed her exactly when Rihanna recorded her own version of the track.</p><h2 id=jessie-j-party-in-the-usa><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessie J – "Party In The USA"</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> was just starting off on her music career, she released her still ever so popular and catchy track, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Party In The USA."</a> What many people might not realize about the song is it wasn't written by Miley at all. Instead, the writing credits go to none other than <a href=#>Jessie J</a>. Back when she wrote the song for Miley, Jessie J still hadn't hit it big as a solo artist herself. The song was an instant hit and spent 28 weeks on the Hot 100, where it reached No. 2. The popularity of the song really helped Jessie J out financially, as the royalties helped pay her rent for a few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charli-xcx-i-love-it><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Charli XCX – "I Love It"</span></h2><p>Charli XCX has become a famous singer and performer over the past couple of years. Before she really made it big in her own right, she was a songwriter for a number of hit songs that you might not know about. Charli might've been featured on the popular track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I Love It"</a> by Icona Pop, however, she was the one who actually wrote it. She originally wrote the song for her own album,&nbsp;but&nbsp;decided that it would be a better fit for Icona Pop.</p><h2 id=kesha-till-the-world-ends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kesha – "'Till The World Ends"</span></h2><p>Over the years, <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> has had so many hits that we can barely count them all. Of course, with all of those songs, she had to have help writing them. One of her hit singles, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Till The World Ends"</a> was actually written by none other than <a href=#>Kesha</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Best Of Hip-Hop: Essential Protest Songs From Eminem, Ice Cube, Kendrick Lamar And Others</a></span></p><p>When Kesha found out she'd be writing for Britney, she put herself in her shoes, and the track was born. Kesha was so happy with&nbsp;the song, and was incredibly proud of herself for writing it for Britney.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry-i-do-not-hook-up><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Katy Perry – "I Do Not Hook Up"</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> was just getting started in the music industry as a performer, she wasn't as big of a name as she is today. As a result, besides making her own music and trying to get it known, she did a bit of writing that ended up going to other singers. Katy was a co-writer for the song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I Do Not Hook Up,"</a> that she was originally supposed to put on her own album. The song didn't make the cut, but&nbsp;American Idol winner <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> heard the song and loved it, deciding to snatch it up and put it on her own record.</p><h2 id=bruno-mars-nothin-on-you><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bruno Mars – "Nothin' On You"</span></h2><p>We all know <a href=#>Bruno Mars</a> to be the talented singer and performer&nbsp;he is today, as he has a list of his own hits that we can count on more than two hands. Before Bruno made it big with his own career, he spent a lot of time writing songs for other artists. One song that you might not realize Bruno was behind was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Nothin' On You"</a> by B.o.B. The rapper should be thankful that Bruno wrote that song for him, as it is his only song to ever hit No. 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Best Queen Songs You’ve Never Heard</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoqaXmr%2B0edahpmavoqTBpnnSqKWgq12bvLN5zq2fnqpdqMGivtJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
