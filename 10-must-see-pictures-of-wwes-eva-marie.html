She was initially brought in to be a member of the E!’s Total Divas cast, so right from the start, wrestling fans had a negative outlook on her, since it didn’t seem like she had a true love for the wrestling business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially signed in 2013, Eva spent most of her time on Total Divas, media appearances, and walking plenty of red carpets, while actually getting in the ring was a lower priority for her, until the past few months. After years of hearing fans rip her robotic personality, and awful in-ring skills, she decided to start training more seriously, in an attempt to prove them all wrong.</p><p>Whether or not you’re a fan of the fire engine red hair, it’s tough to deny that she stands out in a crowd. With her steely looks, fit physique, and tanned complexion, Eva has a lot of attributes that could help her become successful in pro wrestling, if she works hard at fixing her weaker points. Will she be able to? Only time will tell…</p><p>Okay, that’s enough words for now; let’s get to Eva’s must see pictures!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-pre-wwe-days><strong>10. Pre-WWE Days</strong></h2><p>Before the WWE, Eva received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management, eventually moving on to modeling and promotional work – mostly lingerie or bikini photo shoots - to make a living. As you can see, she had long black hair back in the day, which is in stark contrast to her hair these days.</p><p>When she was initially brought into the WWE, people felt she looked too much like a Bella Twin, so to differentiate herself, she went with the bright red style. So far, the look has worked for her, as she still rocks it to this day, and it’s usually a topic of discussion in most of her interviews.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-a-total-diva><strong>9. A Total Diva</strong></h2><p>Hired in 2013, Eva was sent right to WWE’s Performance Center to start training to become a pro wrestler, while at the same time working on E!’s reality show, which followed a number of WWE Divas in their daily lives, including the Bella Twins and Natalya.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she did make some sporadic appearances on Raw, most of her time was spent being a reality star, trying to make it in the WWE, and usually failing. She once tried to get a gig as Fandango’s dancer by telling everyone she was a trained dancer – which, she wasn’t – and failed miserably during her audition with Fandango.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-family-drama><strong>8. Family Drama</strong></h2><p>Most of Eva’s stories stem from either her husband being an overbearing manager, or being around her family, as her Dad tends to get a lot of airtime for being quite an outgoing character. One of the more memorable stories was when Eva and Jonathan (her husband) got engaged after just a few months of dating, without talking to the family first.</p><p>Not only did Jonathan not ask her father first, but she has three older brothers who were not entirely accepting about the marriage when it was finally revealed to them. Eva’s Dad responded with a classic “No! Flat, no!” to the entire situation. Things seemed to smooth out over time, and now, scenes with Eva’s family tend to be consistently one of the more entertaining segments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-outside-ventures><strong>7. Outside Ventures</strong></h2><p>Even before the WWE, Eva took part in plenty of promotional work including fitness infomercials, a Sketchers commercial, and was even Sports Illustrated “Lovely Lady of the Day”. Eva has also found herself on multiple covers including: Glam Fit Magazine, Rukus, and Import Turner Magazine.</p><p>She was a competitor in multiple fashion and model competitions, which in totality, helped give her the necessary experience for much of what she would do with the WWE. The picture above is from a make-up trial/promotion, and needless to say, she looks amazing!</p><p></p><h2 id=6-wwe-s-media-appearances><strong>6. WWE’s Media Appearances</strong></h2><p>With the WWE backing her, Eva started receiving bigger opportunities, like getting a photo shoot with Maxim in 2014, she was also ranked number eighty-three in Maxim’s 2014 “Hot 100”. Her magazine cover resume also increased as she appeared on Iron Man and Muscle and Fitness Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Ms. All Red Everything” has even found opportunities on TV shows like 90210, CSI: New York, and Entourage. At just 31, Eva Marie has built up quite a diverse resume.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-main-roster-appearances><strong>5. Main Roster Appearances</strong></h2><p>After some sporadic 2013 appearances, Eva began showing up on WWE TV more often in 2014, initially, she didn’t feud with anyone, but rather random matches and segments to help her get adjusted to live TV. It was pretty obvious she was nervous being in front of a live audience, and needed to improve quite a bit in the eyes of, well, everyone.</p><p>She took on the then Divas champion, AJ Lee, but was embarrassed in both matches, being defeated easily, in the picture you can see AJ toying with her outside the ring. After a couple months, the two battled again, and Eva got some revenge by winning both matches, thanks mainly to Paige distracting AJ.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-an-untimely-injury><strong>4. An Untimely Injury</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, just as Eva was getting more in-ring time, she found out that one of her breast implants had ruptured, which obviously can be incredibly dangerous to her health. She ended up being out of action for a couple months to heal up, and continued doing media appearances.</p><p>Her run from 2013 until 2014 was basically a disaster in terms of being a pro wrestler. Not only was she flat on the mic, but she wrestled at a snail’s pace, and couldn’t sell to save her life. It was clear that she needed to get serious about wrestling, if she was ever going to gain respect from fans.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-absolute-beauty><strong>3. Absolute Beauty</strong></h2><p>Taking a break from her story, when you have a moment, check out Eva’s Instagram, where there are tons of great shots from her many photo shoots. It was actually really difficult to choose only ten pictures, when she looks awesome in nearly every single one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This shoot was especially eye-popping with the beach as a backdrop and the sun setting in the distance; her bikini was absolutely perfect matching her complexion and hair just right. A big part of pro wrestling is presence, and while she is still working on talking and taunting, just her overall look beats out a large portion of the roster.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-getting-serious-in-the-ring><strong>2. Getting Serious In The Ring</strong></h2><p>In early 2015, she spent a few months <a href=#>working with pro wrestler, Brian Kendrick</a>, learning the ropes, and building up a moveset –including her finisher, the Sliced Red #2 - that would entertain the fans. As you can see in the video, she’s obviously pumped to be improving in the ring, and giving WWE TV another shot.</p><p>Her initial run was bad, really bad, so although these training clips were not mind-blowing, there is definitely some improvement on her part. This time around she was sent to NXT, that way she can work in front of smaller crowds, and slowly build up a foundation, instead of just throwing the Total Diva on Raw, like before.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-the-red-queen-of-nxt><strong>1. "The Red Queen of NXT”</strong></h2><p>After multiple house show appearances, Eva Marie started appearing on NXT to a chorus of boos, thanks to years of negativity, she gets one of the biggest heel reactions on the show. With just a blow of a kiss, Eva is able to send fans into a rage, which might eventually get her a title run, although, fans are very split on Eva ever being a champion though.</p><p>Right now, Eva is riding an undefeated streak (on TV) beating opponents like Carmella, Billie Kay, and Gionna. If she continues to improve, it’s possible she could be near the top of the division in the later parts of 2016. Getting a reaction from the crowd is one of the most important goals for a wrestler, and for Eva Marie, she definitely has that going for her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Wikipedia.org</a>, <a href=#>WWE.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BpZKato6l6tLHEZqeim6Sqv6a%2FjKidZq%2BnmsBusdWaZKaZop6ycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
