These guys aren't afraid to bare all, and many have shown all of themselves in more than just one movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what about the women? While actresses are known to show their breasts in movies, the lower half of their naked body is a lot less common to see. Yet, for some brave actresses, the choice to bare all seemed like a good artistic endeavor. Sure, some unknown actresses go full-frontal in their roles, but that's also the case for the famous, well-established actresses as well. Some went full-frontal during the beginning of their careers while others have stuck with that choice for decades.</p><p>Read on for our list of 8 famous actresses that have bared all and gone with full frontal nudity in their film roles. You might find a few of these surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sharon-stone-in-basic-instinct-1992>8. Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct (1992)</h2><p>When most people think of full frontal nude scenes, Basic Instinct often springs to mind. In an iconic scene in this 1992 erotic thriller, <a title="Sharon Stone Net Worth" href=#>Sharon</a>'s character is in an interrogation room and, to intimidate the interrogators, she uncrosses her legs to show that she's not wearing any underwear. While it's just a brief instance of nudity, it became the talk of the town during the early '90s and is still talked about to this day. During a press tour for the 2006 sequel to the original movie, Sharon said, "People are just sitting there going, 'I don't care what she's saying, I just want to know does she get naked in the movie? Is she naked? Nude nude nude naked, do I see her boobies?'"</p><p></p><h2 id=kelly-preston-in-mischief-1985>7. Kelly Preston in Mischief (1985)</h2><p><a title="Kelly Preston Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Preston</a>, wife of <a title="John Travolta Net Worth" href=#>John Travolta</a>, had some major roles in teen comedies back in the 1980s. While those movies were rife with breast shots (and Kelly participated in a fair number), there were also the occasional full-frontal nude scenes. Kelly had a scene like this in one of her very first movies: the 1985 teen comedy Mischief. In it, she plays a young woman who isn't afraid to get naked. To to the artistic fashion of movies from the '80s, the scene where she bares all is both bright and cheerful--unlike the gritty scenes of the decades to follow. Plus, if you've ever wanted an answer to the age-old carpet/drapes question, you'll get the answer in Mischief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=sissy-spacek-in-carrie-1976>6. Sissy Spacek in Carrie (1976)</h2><p>Typically, when people think of nude scenes, they expect something sexy. With <a title="Sissy Spacek Net Worth" href=#>Sissy Spacek</a>'s scene in Carrie, nothing is sexy about it. In fact, it's downright unsettling. In the very beginning of the film, high school student Carrie is showering in the girl's locker room when she finds she's gotten her first period. Not knowing what the blood is, she comes out screaming, reaching for her classmates. This was a bold choice, especially for the 1970s. The role earned Sissy a 1976 National&nbsp;Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and an Oscar nomination. It was a defining role that propelled her acting career. It looks like this full-frontal scene was a good choice!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heather-graham-in-boogie-nights-1997>5. Heather Graham in Boogie Nights (1997)</h2><p>It's no surprise that a movie about the adult industry would have some nudity. While the biggest talked-about nude scene comes at the end (and features a prosthetic penis), there are other scenes of note as well. <a title="Heather Graham Net Worth" href=#>Heather Graham</a>, who plays Rollergirl in the award-winning 1997 film Boogie Nights, takes off her clothes before getting into bed with <a title="Mark Wahlberg Net Worth" href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a>'s character. Rather than featuring clever camera angles to hide Heather's more private bits, which is a film trick used in most movies, this film showed it all. Considering the subject matter of the movie, that seemed like an obvious choice. While another woman from this list, <a title="Julianne Moore Net Worth" href=#>Julianne Moore</a>, was in this movie, she didn't bare nearly as much as Heather did.</p><p></p><h2 id=isabella-rosselini-in-blue-velvet-1986>4. Isabella Rosselini in Blue Velvet (1986)</h2><p>Blue Velvet, a mystery thriller from 1986, is often on lists of the most unsettling movies. That's not surprising considering it was written and directed by <a title="David Lynch Net Worth" href=#>David Lynch</a>. It takes the classic film noir style and adds sordid sexual situations and uncomfortable scenes. Though it didn't do very well at the box office during its release, it became an immense cult classic in the decades afterward. <a title="Isabella Rossellini Net Worth" href=#>Isabella Rossellini</a>, famous Italian actress, had an important role in the film as a night club singer and sex slave to Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth. As you can imagine, there's a scene in the movie where Isabella bares all. Because of the unsettling themes in the film, the scene can be hard to watch for some viewers. Still, the role helped Isabella become a household name for English-speaking audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=julianne-moore-in-short-cuts-1993>3. Julianne Moore in Short Cuts (1993)</h2><p>Julianne Moore is a respected actress known for a blend of indie and blockbuster roles. Over the years, she's one seven awards, including a 2002 Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress for her role in Far From Heaven. Yet, she doesn't shy away from nudity in her roles. In one of her very first film roles, the 1993 comedy drama Short Cuts, she showed more than you'd expect. Unlike the other entries on this list, the scene in question doesn't feature a fully nude Julianne. Instead, she's wearing a shirt and only her naked bottom half is showing. She said of acting, "My children don't watch my movies. First of all, they're not interested and, secondly, my movies are not for children. As an actor, you're trying to portray the human condition and sometimes we don't wear clothes."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halle-berry-in-monster-s-ball-2001>2. Halle Berry in Monster's Ball (2001)</h2><p>Some performances are so gripping and real that they earn the actors some big awards. That's the case with <a title="Halle Berry Net Worth" href=#>Halle Berry</a> for her role as Leticia in the 2001 romantic drama Monster's Ball. She not only won an Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, but she was also the first African American woman to do so, breaking records. One of the more gripping scenes also happens to be one where we see all of Halle. In it, she and <a title="Billy Bob Thornton Net Worth" href=#>Billy Bob Thorton</a>'s character engage in a gritty sex scene in the living room of his home. In response to criticism for the scene's nudity, Halle said, "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, and it would be a really special script that would require something like that again."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-mirren-in-age-of-consent-1969-and-others>1. Helen Mirren in Age of Consent (1969) and Others</h2><p><a title="Helen Mirren Net Worth" href=#>Helen Mirren</a> is no stranger to nudity. She's shown bits and pieces of herself in roles for decades. Her first bout with full frontal nudity was also one of her very first movies: the 1969 romantic comedy-drama Age of Consent. She even appeared fully nude in the 1979 cult classic Caligula. While she is now almost 70, that hasn't stopped her from baring flesh in recent years as well. For instance, she showed her top half in the 2010 film Love Ranch. She said in an interview about nudity in film, "As you get older, naked stuff gets easier. It's more to do with the role than what men in the audience think. There's a liberation about it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZxZZaWurDB0maYnKyimsC0sdJmq6GZpGK1osLEZpuoppVis7a4y2adq6eeqa6tec2um6KsqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
