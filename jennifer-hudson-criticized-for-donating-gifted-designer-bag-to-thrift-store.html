The note was signed by Sonique Saturday, a handbag designer with a brand of the same name.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s Business Sued Again, This Time By Model Who Didn’t Get Paid</a></span></p><p>Sonique established the brand in 2014 and has become well-known for her Birkin-inspired bags, often with cheeky sayings printed across referencing the classic designer. The bags sell up for $500.</p><p>Of its mission, <a href=#>Sonique Saturday explains</a>, “To provide any and every body with a conversation-starting, empowering fashion accessory.”</p><p>It appears Sonique had gifted Jennifer Hudson, as the note expressed gratitude for having the opportunity to do so. “Ms. Jennifer Hudson, what an hoor to gift you with one of my handbags,” it reads. “You’ve inspired me just as much as every other black girl… and for that I wanted to personally say thank you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I hope you enjoy wearing this just as much as I enjoyed making it for you!” the note concluded.</p><p>The black, oversized purse featured the phrase in white letters, “You fake like this Birkin.” However, it seems Jennifer may have not liked the free bag. Despite the heartfelt note, it appears the bag was donated without ever being worn, let alone the letter making it out of the bag.</p><p>Soon after the video went viral, Jennifer’s social media accounts became flooded with comments questioning why she donated the bag.</p><p>“I truly hope you didn’t even see the bag and it was just a complete misunderstanding,” one person wrote on Instagram, TMZ reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another added, “That’s bold u threw that lady purse she made for u away. She was honored to make u that bag […] I would’ve kept it forever.”</p><p>Interestingly, Sonique Sunday has come to Jennifer’s defense and says the singer doesn’t deserve the backlash she’s getting. Speaking to TMZ, Sonique says that the bag wasn’t a free gift. Rather, Jennifer’s team commissioned her to create the custom piece so they could gift it to the singer to celebrate her accomplishments.</p><p>Moreover, Sonique explained she created the bag for Jennifer in 2014, so there’s no knowing how long she had it before it made its way to a thrift shop, or even how it got there.</p><p>The handbag designer also added there’s a silver lining – the viral video has been great publicity for her brand.</p><p>So far, Jennifer hasn’t commented on the controversy.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kevin Costner Claims Estranged Wife Is Defying Prenup By Refusing To Move Out</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Sonique Saturday</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8mepaehlpq%2FbrTUnaqopl2Yv6rAyJygs52UYrOwvoydpqeZpJ67qHnGop2tnZRisaa%2FyKClnqpdl66oedOoZK2gop6ztXnSraarnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
