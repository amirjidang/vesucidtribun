It pretty much ended before it could truly begin, and before we knew it they were already calling quits on their two-year relationship in 2005.Knightley was already a huge star by the time they split. She'd already gotten <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her breakout role in Star Wars: Phantom Menace</a> and had secured roles in Bend It Like Beckham (2002), Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), Love Actually (2003), and had begun to work with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her long-time collaborator, Joe Wright on Pride & Prejudice</a> (2005).Dornan, on the other hand, was unknown by the time he started dating the actress, and he really <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't get international fame until the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy</a>. Ultimately they couldn't make time for each other, and the fact that she was more famous put a strain on everything.Let's take a look at what really happened between Knightley and Dornan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-never-confirmed-they-were-dating>They Never Confirmed They Were Dating</h2><p>Obviously, the ex-couple are extremely good-looking, so it was only natural that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they met through their modeling careers</a> at a photoshoot for an Asprey campaign in August 2003. Shortly after, they began dating.</p><p>They were able to keep their romance to themselves for about a year until they made their first public appearance together in May 2004. The couple attended the opening of the play As You Like It, which starred Sienna Miller. Dornan later dated Miller (drama), and Knightley reportedly tried to warn her off him (double drama).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keira Knightley Fell Like a Giggling Teenager When She And A Certain Actor Snogged On Screen</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though they were constantly photographed together, Knightley would never confirm they were an item. She only said, "Well, it looks that way, doesn't it?"</p><p>They were seen everywhere together, usually always ruggedly yet stylishly dressed, taking walks or popping to the shops. But as Knightley took on more roles, it started to put a strain on their relationship, and eventually, it resulted in their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Dornan Looks Unrecognizable In These Old Photos</a></span></p><p>"Keira and Jamie have decided to call a halt to their relationship in its current phase but they remain completely committed to each other as friends and will continue to see each other in this capacity," Dornan's rep told People in a statement at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Guardian reporter said she saw Dornan looking rough at the time and that he "didn't smile for months." The Mirror, on the other hand, reported Knightley had "shed a river of tears" over the split and was being comforted by friends.</p><p>One source said, "Keira's gutted. She really thought what she and Jamie had was love but it just wasn't meant to be. They both wanted it to work but in the end it was just untenable. They were having crisis talks on an almost daily basis but the decision was reached to finally call it a day."</p><p>Sources also theorized that they could have split because of Dornan's aspirations to become an actor, but had yet to secure a breakthrough role. If he did this they'd have even less time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another source explained, "When Jamie announced that he wanted to broaden his repertoire and try acting as well as modeling Keira was totally supportive. Keira arranged an interview with her own agents and she was genuinely delighted when he was signed up.</p><p>"While the idea of them both sharing the same profession was romantic, the reality is that they were starting to see less and less of each other. Keira's one of Hollywood's most in-demand actresses and her schedule is really punishing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little-Known Facts About Jamie Dornan's Private Life</a></span></p><p>Knightley has opened up about her relationship though, telling People, "I think it’s important to make time for the people in your life who you love and who love you back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dornan got his breakthrough role in Marie Antionette in 2006. But as we found out years later, the Mirror's sources might have been partly right. Dornan was upset he wasn't "bringing home the bread" while they were together.</p><h2 id=dornan-said-it-was-difficult-being-with-knightley-because-of-her-fame>Dornan Said It Was Difficult Being With Knightley Because Of Her Fame</h2><p>In 2008, Dornan told the Mail on Sunday that he felt "second-rate" to Knightley and felt that her fame was ultimately the cause of their split.</p><p>"There is a big pressure when you go out with someone like Keira," he explained. "You can feel a bit second-rate and that's what started to happen. It's not like I was bringing the bread to the table - and that can start to affect everything.</p><p>"The man is meant to be the Alpha in the relationship on the money and power front and clearly I was not. You feel you have to be dominant in other areas and that leads to problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Keira could see what I was going through and it would have been better if I'd kept it hidden from her. It's a slow process, trying to be this Alpha Male."</p><p>A year after his "alpha" comments, Dornan told the Evening Standard, "That was taken totally out of context. I didn't mean that."</p><p>Dornan also said Knightley's popularity with the tabloids was an eye-opening experience for him. He saw real fame and thought, "I don’t think I’m ever going to be as famous as her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even now though, years later, it seems as if there's a little awkwardness between them. They both attended the BAFTA Tea Party Awards gala in 2015, and the Daily Mail noticed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they tried really hard not to run into each other.</a></p><p>If there are any hard feelings, can't they put it past them and give us a reunion, even maybe an onscreen one? Honestly, they're both married with children and have both gone on to be massive stars. There shouldn't be any more drama. But drama is kinda their expertise. Could you imagine a drama film that combined the sexiness from Atonement and Fifty Shades of Grey? That would be just too much for us.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things People Didn't Know About Jamie Dornan AKA Christian Grey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmo5Wev6J5yqegoKCkobK6ecCnm2aikaK2pnnDqKmnmZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
