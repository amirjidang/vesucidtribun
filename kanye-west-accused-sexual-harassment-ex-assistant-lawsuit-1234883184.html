According to legal documents, Pisciotta was already making “seven figures” on OnlyFans when she was asked to work with Ye in 2021.

Pisciotta claims that he sent her one message that read: “See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I’m f**king them. Then I want her to cheat on me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In another message, she alleges that the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234779257>ex-husband of Kim Kardashian </a>wrote: “Is my d*ck racist? I’m going to stare at pictures of white women with black a**es and beat the sh*t out of my racist d*ck.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, the former assistant says West was “fixated” on knowing the size of her boyfriend’s penis and would unsolicitedly send her footage of him sexually engaging with models.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pisciotta recalled two times witnessing the 46-year-old pleasuring himself – once while on the phone with her, and another time when he allegedly locked himself in a room with her during a private flight to Paris. She says the Grammy-winner then laid down on a bed and masturbated under covers until he fell asleep.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to Pisciotta, Ye let her go in October 2022 after she allegedly turned down a $4,000,000 offer to be his Chief of Staff.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The adult-content creator is now suing West for wrongful termination and breach of contract. She claims she’s owed a $3,000,000 severance package that was promised, but never paid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cur8XEZq6eq6RirqSv1KycnWWjmsW2rctmn5qqkajArrHNrWSesF2WwLS10q2Yp6xdoa64v9Siq2ZpYmiBeYSSam9tZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
