Of course, Little Bavaria never became as famous as Hugh Hefner’s home, which is so well known that people still want to know <a href=#>what the Playboy Mansion is like today</a>. However, many of Siegfried & Roy’s devoted fans are aware of Little Bavaria and they want to know what happened to the estate.</p><h2 id=little-bavaria-was-changed-following-roy-horn-rsquo-s-life-changing-injuries>Little Bavaria Was Changed Following Roy Horn’s Life-Changing Injuries</h2><p>After Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn met as young men, the pair discovered that they had a shared passion for performing that made them quick friends and partners. Once Siegfried & Roy started performing together, their distinctive show caught the eye of more and more powerful people until they earned the chance to bring their act to Las Vegas. A huge hit with Vegas audiences, Siegfried & Roy continued to perform in Las Vegas for years before tragedy struck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being talented magicians, <a href=#>Siegfried & Roy </a>made white tigers a huge part of their stage show. On October 3rd, 2003, Siegfried & Roy were performing when suddenly things went horribly awry. Even though he had worked with the animal almost daily since it was six months old, Roy Horn was attacked by a white tiger named Mantacore. Bitten and dragged off stage, Horn barely escaped with his life after he suffered massive blood loss, his spine was severed, and he had a stroke.</p><p>After Roy Horn was attacked on stage, he proved how much he loves animals by insisting the attack wasn’t the white tiger Mantacore’s fault and protecting the animal from calls for it to be put down. Sadly, Horn’s life would never be the same as the injuries he suffered during the tiger attack permanently impaired his motor and verbal abilities. As a result, Horn was forced to retire and he needed help to live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Siegfried & Roy avoided questions about their sexuality and the nature of their relationship. Despite that, it is widely believed that the men were a couple at one point but the length of their relationship is completely unknown. That said, one thing is very clear, Siegfried & Roy were extremely loyal to each other. After all, instead of trying to perform by himself, Siegfried Fischbacher retired at the same time that Roy Horn did so he could take care of his longtime partner and friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most importantly,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Siegfried had the pair’s home known as Little Bavaria altered</a> so that Roy could get around. For example, it was reported that Siegfried had “hip-high rails” “constructed along the winding sidewalks so Roy would have something firm to grasp on his walks around the property”. On top of that “Siegfried also oversaw the construction of a new house designed to ease Roy's transition”</p><h2 id=siegfried-amp-roy-rsquo-s-little-bavaria-estate-remains-closed-to-the-public>Siegfried & Roy’s Little Bavaria Estate Remains Closed To The Public</h2><p>Over the years, there have been celebrities who’ve opened their private homes up to the public tours. For example, part of the reason why <a href=#>Elvis Presley’s estate is worth so much</a> is that his former home Graceland has become a tourist attraction. On the other hand, even though he some people visit, <a href=#>Michael Jackson saw Neverland Ranch as the place where he brought up his kids</a> and where he could escape the public.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch Haunted?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Siegfried & Roy seemed to genuinely love their fans, there also was no doubt that the duo wanted to keep their home private. After all, when he was asked about fans possibly getting to tour the pair’s home someday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Siegfried Fischbacher made it very clear that Little Bavaria was never going to be open to the public</a>. “Absolutely not. This is our private — no, no, no. It’s our thing. We’ve had some offers, people who wanted to do take over the Jungle Palace and do other things. But no, no.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Almost a year after Roy Horn passed away due to complications from the COVID-19 virus, his longtime partner and friend Siegfried Fischbacher succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Now that Siegfried & Roy have both passed away, the person who inherited their estate could decide to open up their beloved home. It has been reported that Siegfried & Roy’s wills dictated that their liquid assets would go to a foundation dedicated to the protection of white tigers and a trust. However, when it comes to their pair’s beloved home Little Bavaria, the identity of the person who inherited it is unknown. That said, it is clear that whoever owns Little Bavaria now, the estate remains closed to the public and there is no reason to believe that will change.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Top 10 Celebrity Estates Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br%2FInp6fqpmasW6tzZ1kq6epqHqttdOto55lkpbDor7ImmShp52aeqq6jKWYrGWmmrSiv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
