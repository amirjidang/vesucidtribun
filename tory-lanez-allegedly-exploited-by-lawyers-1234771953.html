They’re acting on his behalf. … They’re not really asking him what he wants.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cuniff also recalled Dixon’s meeting with <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234771116>the 30-year-old entertainer</a>. “His eyes were black. He was totally despondent,” Dixon said. “He told me he wanted to go to state prison. I said, ‘You want to go to state prison? Why?'” to which Lanez responded “At least I’ll be able to go out in the yard and talk to people.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That upset me. I don’t think he’s guilty,” she admitted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tory Lanez is due in court today.

Peterson’s conviction is not punishable by death. Because he will apply for probation, file an appeal, and pursue additional post-conviction remedies, this court should admit him bail within the court’s discretion.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Merely because he is well known, the Sheriff has decided that Mr. Peterson is of such great threat that he must be confined in the same manner as those convicted of serial rape charges and murder,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-911245688.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As of publication, it has not been made public knowledge as to why Dixon’s motion was denied by the presiding judge, even though in June, Lanez and his legal team signed a substitution of counsel. He now awaits sentencing for the third time on Aug. 7. The date was&nbsp;pushed back again last month when the judge granted a continuance for Lanez’s attorneys.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sentencing was originally scheduled for Jan. 2, a month after he was found guilty, and<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234693815> then pushed to Feb. 28</a> because he changed counsel. During that court date, Lanez filed a motion for a new <a href=# id=auto-tag_trial data-tag=trial>trial</a>, to which he was denied.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The One Umbrella Records founder is now facing a maximum sentence of 22 years and eight months after being found guilty of shooting&nbsp;Megan Thee Stallion in the foot.
