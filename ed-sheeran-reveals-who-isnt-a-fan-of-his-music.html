Ed, who is known for his music, tattoos, and red hair, made headlines following his nuptials to Cheer Seaborn.</p><p>Following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their ultra-low-key wedding</a>, the duo welcomed their first child together, Lyra Antarctica. While there was much discussion surrounding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their new daughter's name</a>, it appears as if she's making headlines again, after Ed revealed she may not be a Sheeran fan!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why Ed Sheeran's Tattoos Are So Controversial</a></span></p><h2 id=who-isn-t-a-fan-of-ed-s-music>Who Isn't A Fan Of Ed's Music?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Sheeran is without a doubt one of the best musicians to grace the industry in quite some time! The singer first came about back in 2011 with the success of his single 'The A Team', which catapulted him to international fame and success.</p><p>A decade later, Sheeran is hands-down one of the biggest names, and it's all thanks to his many hits! While Ed is known for his bangers, the artist's biggest claim to fame is none other than his stellar songwriting abilities.</p><p>Sheeran has gone on to write songs for Tori Kelly, One Direction, Justin Bieber, Liam Payne, and Taylor Swift, to name a few, and that's not including what he writes for himself. With his growing success in the industry, it is no surprise that Ed has managed to amass a net worth of $200 million.</p><p>With a career like his, it's only fitting that Ed gains millions of followers, however, it appears as if he has met his first critic, his own daughter!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Sheeran and his wife, Cherry Seaborn, officially tied the knot back in 2019 and have remained happily in love ever since. In September of last year, the couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed their first child together,</a> Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran.</p><p>While she is as cute as can be, it seems as if Lyra is not at all a fan of Ed's music, so much that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she cries every time it comes on</a>. Ouch!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Are Ed Sheeran And Taylor Swift Really Friends?</a></span></p><p>The hitmaker revealed to Radio 1's Big Weekend last month that despite his success in the industry, he cannot seem to impress his 9-month old daughter when it comes to his music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ll sing to my daughter, who’s not my biggest fan. She just cries,” the British singer shared. Although Lyra's taste certainly has time to evolve, we can't imagine her disdain being an easy pill for Ed to follow, especially when it comes to new music.</p><p>Luckily for the singer, his daughter does, in fact, enjoy some of his more dated hits.&nbsp;“No, I’ve got some she likes. She really likes ‘Shape of You,’" he said.</p><p>When it comes to which styles she gravitates towards, Ed says that anything with heavy bass or rock vibes doesn't sit well with Lyra. "The marimba sound is good, but she doesn’t like anything loud or anything belt-y.”</p><p>Despite Ed's efforts to win over his daughter with his music, he and Cherry have been head over heels happy when it comes to parenthood, and while he'd love to gush all about it, the singer prefers to keep more intimate details private.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Posts To Ed Sheeran’s Instagram That Fans Adore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicnWWjnbKmvsCnZKudppqurb%2BMsJ%2BoZZmou7V5wGadmqZdpLNutMisZKato56wcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
