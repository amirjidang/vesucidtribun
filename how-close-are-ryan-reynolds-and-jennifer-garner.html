As the actor prepared to make <a href=#>his debut as Deadpool in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</a>, Reynolds was also busy assembling a cast that could possibly rival Marvel Studios’ own ensemble films to date.</p><p>After getting frenemy Hugh Jackman to <a href=#>suit up once more as Wolverine</a>, it was also recently confirmed that <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a> is also joining the cast of Deadpool 3. And much to fans’ delight, the actress is also suiting up as the superhero Elektra once again.</p><p>Now, for years, it certainly seemed like Garner has long put her superhero past behind her. But as it turns out, all it may have taken is some nudging from good pal Ryan Reynolds.</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-brought-jennifer-garner-onboard-for-the-adam-project-staging-a-13-going-on-30-reunion>Ryan Reynolds Brought Jennifer Garner Onboard For The Adam Project, Staging A 13 Going On 30 Reunion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jennifer-garner-and-mark-ruffalo-in-the-adam-project.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reynolds and director Shawn Levy decided to collaborate once more following the success of Free Guy and that’s how the two ended up signing on for The Adam Project.</p><p>Up until then, The Adam Project had been titled Our Name Is Adam and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise was supposed to play the lead role</a>. But when <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> took over the film from Paramount Pictures, a lot of things changed and finally, the project also developed some real momentum.</p><p>With Netflix taking over and Reynolds and Levy attached, the script was immediately reworked. Not long after, Reynolds and Levy started looking at putting together the cast. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking at the SiriusXM Town Hall hosted by Jess Cagle</a>, Levy admitted that they knew “early on” that Mark Ruffalo should play Reynolds’ father.</p><p>When Ruffalo signed on, Levy’s wife readily suggested that Garner should be cast as Reynolds’ onscreen mom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hugh Jackman Admits To Having Second Thoughts About Quitting Wolverine</a></span></p><p>When Levy told Reynolds about the suggestion, the actor pointed out that if they did that, they would be “unintentionally” staging a 13 Going On 30 reunion between Garner’s Jenna and Ruffalo’s Mattie.</p><p>“So it seems like a really mercenary choice, but it was just based on the two best actors for the part,” he also added. Reynolds also likened having Garner and Ruffalo play his parents to “filming my vision board.”</p><h2 id=the-stars-have-said-the-sweetest-thing-about-working-on-their-first-film-together>The Stars Have Said The Sweetest Thing About Working On Their First Film Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ryan-reynolds-walker-scobell-and-jennifer-garner-at-the-adam-project-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While doing the press tour for the movie, Garner and Reynolds had nothing but nice things to say about working together. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Good Morning America</a> with Ruffalo, the actress also took the time to praise the “amazing” Reynolds for his dedication to the film as both the lead actor and producer, saying the star “killed it every single day.”</p><p>Garner also added that Reynolds was just “heaven” to work with.</p><p>Similarly, Reynolds also had sweet words for Garner after working on their first movie together. The actor took to Instagram to share photos with his co-stars. And in one post, he also wrote that “everybody feels thirty percent better standing next” to The Last Thing He Told Me star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Jennifer Garner Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>Garner herself took to social media to praise Reynolds for his work on their first movie together.

You killed it,” the actress also added. Garner also ended her message for Reynolds with the signature “Love, Mom.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-was-confirmed-to-be-joining-the-cast-of-deadpool-3-too>Jennifer Garner Was Confirmed To Be Joining The Cast Of Deadpool 3 Too</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ryan-reynolds-at-the-premiere-of-deadpool-2.jpg><p>Now fans may be hoping for Garner and Reynolds to reunite onscreen for some time now and fortunately, they won’t have to wait too long. Recently, it was confirmed that Garner had signed on to join Reynolds and Jackman in Deadpool 3 where she will once again suit up as Elektra.</p><p>The actress was last seen as the superhero in the 2005 film Elektra (reports state Garner was forced to do the movie as it was part of her contract, along with <a href=#>the Ben Affleck-led Daredevil</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the movie turned out to be a box office flop, however, Garner moved on, building a successful career with several non-superhero movies and the hit series Alias.</p><p>Looking back on her time as Marvel’s Elektra, Garner told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was a “shame” that she never got to experience</a> the <a href=#><strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></a> (MCU) under the leadership of Kevin Feige.</p><p>When the current Marvel boss took over, Garner noted that everything became “elevated.” Fortunately, the actress is now poised to work with both Reynolds and Feige.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meet Walker Scobell, The Young Star Of 'The Adam Project'</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Garner’s involvement in the MCU also gives Reynolds another opportunity to stage a second onscreen reunion between the actress and Ruffalo right after The Adam Project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two stars have also made it clear that they plan to work together again real soon with Garner insisting that they would not wait another 18 years just to do another film again. Ruffalo even joked that they could start a 13 Going on 30 film franchise together.</p><p>Meanwhile, Levy also teased on social media in 2022 that Ruffalo and Reynolds might just continue their bromance in Deadpool 3. It would seem like Garner would get to work with her two favorite co-stars again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXafGorqMq5yypp%2BhsbR5wKebZqKVo7uqssSrZKCZoqOys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
