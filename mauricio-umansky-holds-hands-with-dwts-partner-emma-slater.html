Ahead of the season premiere, <a href=#>the Buying Beverly Hills star exclusively told Us Weekly</a> how excited he was to work with Slater.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mauricio-Umansky-Raises-Eyebrows-for-Holding-Hands-With-Dancing-With-the-Stars-Partner-Emma-Slater.jpg><p>“Emma’s an absolute veteran and so good,” he gushed in September. “I needed somebody that was super competitive. And we’re just gonna go crush it and we’re gonna create magic.”</p><p>As Umansky has grown close to Slater on the dance floor, his complicated relationship with estranged wife Richards, 54, has continued to make headlines. News broke in July that <a href=#>Umansky and Richards’ relationship hit a rough patch</a> after 27 years of marriage.</p><p>“We have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage,” the pair, who share daughters Alexia, 27, Sophia, 23, and Portia, 15, <a href=#>wrote via Instagram that same month</a>. “But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part. Although we are in the public eye, we ask to be able to work through our issues privately.” (Richards also shares daughter Farrah, 34, with ex-husband <strong>Guraish Aldjufrie</strong>.)</p><p>While Umansky and Richards stressed at the time that they are not getting divorced, <a href=#>they have since confirmed that they’re at a crossroads</a>.</p><p>“Kyle and I are human beings. We have emotions, we have feelings, we’re going through a really hard time. We are currently separated,” <a href=#>Umansky told TMZ</a> on September 29. “We are not talking about divorce. We’re trying to deal with this stuff internally, with ourselves, privately.”</p><p>The twosome’s relationship status was called into question once again when the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>season 13 trailer dropped earlier this month. In the video, Richards’ costars questioned what was happening with her marriage, with <a href=#><strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong></a> asking, “If there was infidelity, would you stay?”</p><p>Richards <a href=#>replied in the October 3 clip</a>, “I don’t know.” Her dynamic with Umansky was scrutinized even more in the trailer after Richards was shown tattooing the letter “K” on pal <a href=#><strong>Morgan Wade</strong></a>’s body.</p><p>The Halloween Kills actress has <a href=#>previously denied that she’s in a romantic relationship</a> with Wade, 28, after rumors surfaced this summer.</p><p>Umansky, meanwhile, explained via social media that <a href=#>his October 3 DWTS misstep</a> was due in part to the RHOBH trailer coming out. (Umansky was almost eliminated from DWTS after missing a “big chunk” of his routine on Latin Night due to stress from his family drama coming out on RHOBH.)</p><p>“Right before the dance, the trailer for the [upcoming season of] Real Housewives of Beverly Hills came out about my marriage, and my kids were in the [Dancing With the Stars] audience and I wasn’t addressing it with them,” <a href=#>Umansky told Slater</a> during the October 10 episode.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Slater, for her part, has been working through her own relationship hardships after splitting from fellow DWTS pro <a href=#><strong>Sasha Farber</strong></a> last year. Us broke the news in August 2022 that Slater and Farber, 39, <a href=#>had separated that April</a>. Slater <a href=#>filed for divorce in February</a> and has since had to work alongside her estranged husband for the ABC dance competition.</p><p>“It’s not a nightmare at all,” <a href=#>she told E! News in October</a> of seeing Farber regularly. “We support each other so much that I want the very best for Sasha. I love him and <a href=#><strong>Alyson [Hannigan]</strong></a> together on the show. We support each other, very, very truly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaWntqS1zmasppmeqLi6eceoo52rXZ2ur7DSZq6irJhisbjA0manmqqko7KzecSmpJplo6GutbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
