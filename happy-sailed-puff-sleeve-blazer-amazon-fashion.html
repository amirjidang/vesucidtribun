On repeat! While we’re definitely not against repeating a great outfit, sometimes we start to feel like a specific outfit is the only wearable option we have. Our mind goes blank when we try to put any other pieces together in our head. We need something new every once in a while — especially if we’re planning on seeing the same people or even taking photos!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While we’re definitely not against repeating a great outfit, sometimes we start to feel like a specific outfit is the only wearable option we have. Our mind goes blank when we try to put any other pieces together in our head. We need <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">something new</a> every once in a while — especially if we’re planning on seeing the same people or even taking photos!</p><p>How about grabbing a new piece that can help create many different chic outfits? Something like a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cute spring blazer</a> you can wear to elevate anything from leggings and a tee to a slip dress and heels. Bonus points for grabbing it on sale!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p>This Happy Sailed blazer is capturing the hearts of shoppers everywhere — plus the envy of onlookers who want one of their own. Now is a fantastic time to buy it too, as it’s officially under $50. Plus, it’s suitable for the upcoming season. It’s a nice, lightweight layer that can work for a variety of occasions!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This lined blazer</a> has a lapel collar, functional flap pockets and an open front. No button closures! If you want to wear it closed, however, you can always slip a belt around your waist. It’s a flattering effect too!</p><p>But the main detail that stuck out to Us, of course, is the sleeve design. The sleeves are ruched and add on pretty puffs at the shoulders for a feminine yet structured look!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p>This blazer comes in 12 solid shades, making finding the hue that suits you a cinch. We know so many will be drawn to the black version, but light pink and light green are so cute too. There are also options like grey, white and khaki if you want something that will go with as many other pieces as possible. There’s also a bonus 13th option on the page, which is black with pearlescent accents on the pockets!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This blazer</a> is machine washable, so you can keep it fresh and clean for every time you want to wear it. You could wear it to the office with a blouse and slacks, or you could take it for a night out with a mini dress and heeled booties. It’s ready for a shopping trip downtown too with jeans and a mock-neck top, or for a breezy sidewalk brunch with a flowy jumpsuit. You’ll wear this piece on repeat, but the outfit options will feel endless!</p><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p><strong>Not your style?
