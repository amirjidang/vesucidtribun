According to the stars, each of us is a highly unique creature with a special purpose in this life. Instagram is teeming with astrology memes, cosmic predictions, and posts about all twelve zodiac signs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Trust Healing Crystals (Other Than Heidi Montag & Spencer Pratt)" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Trust Healing Crystals (Other Than Heidi Montag & Spencer Pratt)</a></span></p><p>Some turn to astrology when making difficult decisions, some want to understand themselves better, while some want to learn what the future holds for them. Celebrities, too, love to consult the planets ever so often. Astrology is especially popular among women.</p><h2 id=shirley-maclaine><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Shirley MacLaine</span></h2><p>Shirley MacLaine became a household name in the sixties. She might not be the youngest soul around, but she's into all things New Age. She's all about UFO sightings, superconsciousness, trance channeling, and of course, astrology.</p><p>MacLaine even published several books Out on a Limb and <span class=a-size-medium>Going Within: A Guide for Inner Transformation.</span></p><h2 id=albert-einstein><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Albert Einstein</span></h2><p>Astrology is not a science and is thus often disregarded as a bunch of mumbo jumbo. It might come as a surprise that one of the greatest scientists who ever lived loved the teachings of this ancient belief system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Albert Einstein knew that there is more to this world than meets the eye. If he were alive today, he'd probably be all over the upcoming Age of Aquarius.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cameron Diaz</span></h2><p>Cameron Diaz has great connections in the world of astrology. She's a long-term client of one of the world's most famous astrologers, Susan Miller. It's been a while since Diaz left her Hollywood career behind and focused on her well-being instead.</p><p>When planning the future, she loves to consult the stars. Virgos are typically very grounded and realistic, so it's pretty surprising that she turns to the planets for answers.</p><h2 id=princess-diana><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Princess Diana</span></h2><p>Penny Thornton is one of the world's leading astrologers. One of her clients was Princess Diana who came to seek answers about the future of her marriage with Prince Charles from the stars. Diana's story arc is one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most tragic ones on Netflix's The Crown</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cancers and Scorpios are said to make a great pair, but things unfortunately didn't work out well for the Prince and Princess of Wales. Charles eventually found happiness with another Cancer native, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Angelina Jolie</span></h2><p>Jolie follows the teachings of the Buddhist astrology, also known as Tibetan astrology. It's highly related to concepts of Karma: we bring into this life the consequences of the previous one. Karma impacts how we act and what direction our lives will go.</p><p>She has used astrology to choose her movie roles and make decisions regarding her health.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kendall Jenner</span></h2><p>Scorpios don't have the reputation for being the nicest zodiac sign, but they are typically renowned for their beauty and sex appeal. No wonder Kendall Jenner made a point to emphasize that she's a Scorpio native in 2016: "I'm a Scorpio, so I stick to people. If I love you, I love you. If I don't like you, you're screwed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's true: while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall loves to take adorable pictures with her nephews</a>, she is not all smiles with strangers.</p><h2 id=madonna><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Madonna</span></h2><p>Madonna is a huge wellness aficionado: she's one of those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities who are committed to a daily meditation practice</a> and she is no stranger to crystals and astrology either. She's been on the astrology train back in the nineties already, back when the internet wasn't swarming with astrology memes yet.</p><p>While most celebrities only know their sun sign, Madonna knows her big three: she's a Leo with a Virgo moon and an Aquarius rising.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>In an interview she did with <span class=redactor-invisible-space>Petra Collins</span> for Dazed, Selena celebrated her zodiac sign: "I'm such a cancer, I'm sensitive as f*ck. I feel everything so intensely, which is one of my favorite things about myself. Feeling is something I love."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="20 Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez Throwback Pics Too Sweet To Ignore" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez Throwback Pics Too Sweet To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Many of her fans don't know that Selena</a> has a strong fear of rejection. When Cancers get hurt, they hide in their shells and won't come out for a while.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>Lady Gaga has her own squad of spiritual advisors who she turns to when planning tours. A big no-no for her are Mercury retrogrades; it's the time of communication breakdowns and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this fearless Aries</a> is not the one to take any chances.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Times Lady Gaga Went Makeup-Free" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Times Lady Gaga Went Makeup-Free</a></span></p><p>Those who wonder how can it be that an Aries native creates such emotional music should know that Lady Gaga has a Scorpio moon, so she has an ability to dive deep into her emotions.</p><h2 id=beyonc><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Beyoncé</span></h2><p>Beyoncé is indeed flawless: this Virgo sun with a Scorpio moon knows what it means to work hard and strive for perfection. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She is a typical Virgo in many regards</a> and has recognized this fact herself: "I am a control freak. I pay attention to details. When I do something I do it 100 percent. I have high expectations of myself and expect the exact same thing of everyone around me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This self-proclaimed perfectionist even has a song about the zodiac signs, but it's not among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her biggest hits</a>. It came out in 2003 and it's called "Signs".</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Regretted Getting Tattoos" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Regretted Getting Tattoos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJudnJ6yt7GMoqVmmaOpv7C4zqCwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
