Given all of this, it's fair to be curious about the true nature of their relationship. Are they two actors from very different worlds who don't really want to work with one another, or is there some genuine comradery there? Let's take a look...</p><h2 id=did-emily-blunt-actually-like-working-with-dwayne-the-rock-johnson>Did Emily Blunt Actually Like Working With Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson?</h2><p>Emily Blunt never actually met Dwayne Johnson until she started working on Disney's Jungle Cruise back in 2018, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a May 2021 interview </a>on The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a> Show. During the interview with her real-life friend, Howard, Emily discussed her impressive degree and who exactly she's enjoyed working with the most. Emily, of course, praised Meryl Streep, who she's worked with three times, including in The Devil Wears Prada. As Emily went down the list of the biggest names that she's worked with, she landed on Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Great actor," Howard Stern's co-host, Robin Quivers, joked.</p><p>"Yeah, one of the greatest actors I've ever seen," Howard laughed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Dwayne Johnson's Relationship With Danny DeVito</a></span></p><p>"You know what, you guys. And let me just speak about my friend here. Because he is one of my favorite people on Earth," Emily Blunt said. "I will tell you something that people don't know about DJ. And the interesting thing is... that when you do meet him, and you sort of meet that... I mean, honestly, when I first met him I thought, 'He's going to be like his Instagram personality all big and bombastic.' To the point that hen I met him I went, 'HEY!' Like really big. Like I should please him and match his personality. It was so embarrassing!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, Emily said that Dwayne literally whispered 'hello'. She said that he was a bit shy and a bit tentative. But, overall, Emily said that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was...</p><p>"The most polite man I have ever met in my life," Emily said authentically. "So, when you see him do The Rock, I said to him, 'That's the performance of a lifetime. He is the antithesis of who you are.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Blunt And John Krasinski: 15 BTS Facts About Their Biggest Roles</a></span></p><p>Because of Dwayne's performance as the wrestler and his big, hulky physique, Emily says that he gets pigeon-holed by Hollywood and he's really a lot more than Howard and Robin were giving him credit for.</p><p>"In the past, he's been put into these movies because he doesn't look like anyone. Right? So, he can't come and do the western with me, right? He can't come and do that. He can't do Remains of the Day. So, he gets put in these movies that are sort of to accommodate his colossal size or image."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emily went on to praise Dwayne's work in their upcoming Disney movie, Jungle Cruise, saying that he absolutely adopted a different kind of character.</p><p>"It's a real character. it's a real performance. So, for me, I only experienced that with him. And I loved it. He's a joy."</p><p>"But when they say to you, 'Hey, how about doing this movie with The Rock?' You might have hesitation because, before you knew him, you might say, 'Gee, this guy is from the wrestling world and I understand he's got big muscles and he has a certain look and a certain ability to do action films'" Howard asked.</p><p>Emily explained that he remembered watching The Rock in Get Smart and thinking he was funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, for me, I always thought, 'That would be fun [to work with The Rock]."</p><h2 id=dwayne-clearly-likes-emily-blunt-too>Dwayne Clearly Likes Emily Blunt Too</h2><p>The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in their promotional material for Jungle Cruise is undeniable. In her interview with Howard Stern, Emily admitted that she can adapt to other people's energies. This could be seen as somewhat fraudulent, but not in Emily's case. This is because&nbsp;she genuinely wants to know everything about someone and meeting them at their level is the best way to do that. It seems as though her fascination with Dwayne Johnson paid off as the two of them have built a completely dynamic and engaging friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only have the two of them become friends thanks to Jungle Cruise, but Dwayne Johnson entrusted Emily with one of his pride possessions...&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his 45,000-pound traveling gym</a>. Unlike every other one of Dwayne's costars, Emily Blunt was allowed to work out in it.</p><p>According to Emily's 2021 interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, this is something Dwayne never lets anyone else do. While Emily said that she never used the gym at the same time as he did, save for a couple of press teasers, she mentioned that the entire crew was surprised that he let her use it.</p><p>Clearly, the two of them had an immediate kinship on the set of The Jungle Cruise. So much so that Emily would defend The Rock to Howard Stern and he would let her use his precious private gym.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Emily Blunt Wishes John Krasinski Was Less American</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6prnIpbBmmpyqu7V5wKebZpynlsavsYyjpqGmo6S7tHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
