From the beginning, Andrei clashed with his wife’s family, butting heads with her father, <strong>Chuck Potthast</strong>, about finances. Things escalated after the TV personality <a href=#>asked Potthast for a $100,000 loan</a> to start his own house-flipping business and he declined, instead hiring Andrei as an employee in the family property management business.</p><p>After the lovebirds tied the knot and debuted on 90 Day’s spinoff series Happily Ever After, the Moldova native went on to <a href=#>be at odds with Elizabeth’s siblings</a>. The tension culminated in a family brawl during the finale of season six and seemingly hasn’t been resolved.</p><p>“Let’s just say I’m getting older. I’m more mature,” the reality star explained to Us. “I have my own family and I see things through a different lens now than I used to when I was younger. And so I’m learning more about my family and who’s around me and I just see it differently.”</p><p>Andrei added that he could “take credit” for contributing to her change in perspective. “I opened her eyes more. She knew that there was something, but I did more for you so you can understand [where] the negative comes from,” he shared.</p><p>The TLC personality also shared that there would be “<a href=#>a lot of reveals concerning family members</a>” this upcoming season.</p><p>“It took some time to realize what kind of people we were dealing with,” he told Us. “It’s gonna be intense once again. It’s very hard for me because I see her … it hurts her.”</p><p>Elizabeth opened about the cultural differences between her and Andrei’s family, noting that Americans can be “very forgiving” whereas his family is more “cutthroat” in how they handle conflict.</p><p>“Yeah, but that means you don’t have to deal with constant problems, constant friction if it’s not needed,” the Eastern European native stated.</p><p>“Well, it’s hard when it’s family … but yes,” Elizabeth responded.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After</a> airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaHBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ2jYrKttdmamZ6smGKwor%2FTq5ivnaRiu7DAjKilZp%2BfpLFuwMSrpKxllpa6qrjYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
