We'll take a look back at his journey and why he decided to go completely off the map, ending the gig altogether.<strong>Updated on January 16, 2023:</strong> Richard Sandrak has officially left the world of bodybuilding behind, though he still enjoys staying active. He has been working as a stunt performer for the last several years, employed with ACTION HORIZON and Universal Studios. He now works for hire in the Los Angeles area. Despite his iconic and legendary standing as a child, he has a particularly small following on social media, with less than 2,000 followers on his Instagram page. He does not post much, leaving fans guessing what adventures he is up to now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=little-hercules-became-a-sensation-for-his-look>Little Hercules Became A Sensation For His Look</h2><p>At bodybuilding events back in the day, fans would line up to meet "Little Hercules," given his insane ripped look at such a young age. However, years after the fact, rumors started to float around discussing his childhood.</p><p>It is said that the man behind "Little Hercules," Richard Sandrak, had a tough upbringing, which featured no toys, and even possible enhancement use.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey Moved Off The Map A Decade Ago And Won't Return To Hollywood</a></span></p><p>However, according to The List, "Little Hercules" denied these details, "I've never been forced to train or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">do anything against my will</a>," he told the outlet. "My parents used to train all the time and I wanted to join in. It was mostly my choice. It's just what I grew up doing. I was never forced. It was never an issue."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have to say my parents are my heroes because they've helped me develop throughout my life," Sandrak made reference to his mother in the statement.</p><p>Despite his love for bodybuilding, things would change for the young phenom. As he grew older, his interest changed, and he would completely switch paths.</p><h2 id=richard-sandrak-stopped-bodybuilding-completely-and-went-off-the-map>Richard Sandrak Stopped Bodybuilding Completely And Went Off The Map</h2><p>Sandrak is in his 30s these days and his life seems to be a little different. Alongside Inside Edition, he revealed that bodybuilding is no longer his go-to. In fact, he left it behind completely, deciding that he was bored with it all.</p><p>As of 2015, "Little Hercules" had a new role, working as a stuntman at the Universal Studios Waterworld over in Los Angeles. A typical day sees him setting himself on fire, along with jumping into the water from very high up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of Tom Cruise's Craziest Stunts Performed In His Films</a></span></p><p>Although he's living a different lifestyle these days, Sandrak revealed that he has no regrets when it comes to his past, and won't hide away from it.</p><p>"I am very proud of my past; it is not something I don't want anyone to know anymore," he told Inside Edition. "I am just not stuck living in it anymore."</p><p>Richard's update on Inside Edition got millions of views on YouTube and, for the most part, it seems as though people are in agreement that he made the right call to step away from the world of bodybuilding for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-think-sandrak-made-the-right-decision-to-switch-his-lifestyle>Fans Think Sandrak Made The Right Decision To Switch His Lifestyle</h2><p>Fans on both YouTube and Reddit chimed in on this career switch. For the most part, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans agree that Sandrak made the right decision</a>, especially given how troublesome his upbringing was.</p><p>"Richard's upbringing was rather abnormal. It's no surprise he rejected the lifestyle of his abusive father. After his father was sent to prison, Richard was also ordered by a judge to refrain from weight training for some significant portion of his remaining childhood. Often times when a youngster it pushed into an activity too early, they'll be burnt out on it by the time they're adults. I wonder if that may be what happened here. He looks healthy and happy, that's the main thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main theme among fans seems to be that as long as he's happy and healthy, that's really what counts the most.</p><p>One Twitter user shared, "At the end of the day, he has to be happy with himself! If he doesn't wanna lift weights anymore that's fine, he's a grown man!"</p><p>At the end of the day, Sandrak seems to have put that accomplishment in the rearview mirror, but to his credit, he doesn't shy away when it comes to talking about it.</p><p>He'll forever look back at that time fondly, but clearly he has since moved on for the next chapter of his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2BledKapZ2qkaB6rbXTraOeZZiav6TBy56qZq2ep7Kku8anoLOZkqGybrvFn2StoJViuqK8jLCfnqqVYq6zsYytn56xXaO8uHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
