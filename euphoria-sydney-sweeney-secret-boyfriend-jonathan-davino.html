Right now, she's probably thankful she kept one aspect of her life a secret: her mystery man Jonathan Davino. While everyone is wondering who Sydney Sweeney is dating, it seems as if she'd rather keep her love life on the down-low.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Shocked By Sydney Sweeney's Secret Passions</a></span></p><p>Despite her attempts to keep her relationship private, her fans still have plenty of opinions about her man – including <a href=#>many that aren't too positive</a>. If this experience has taught her anything, it's to keep her cards even closer to her chest. Still, we're wildly curious about what made her keep him private in the first place. How will this recent drama affect her already super-glued lips?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sydney Sweeney first came to prominence back in 2009 when she landed a role on Heroes. Well, it didn't take much time before her career catapulted, and Sweeney now has Euphoria, Handmaid's Tale, and Sharp Objects on her resume. Despite her professional career being an open book, her love life isn't. The actress keeps a very low profile when it comes to her dating life, and her reported relationship with restaurateur Jonathan Davino is no exception.</p><p>The two have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly been dating since 2018</a>, however, fans continue to remain on the outs when it comes to private details regarding their romance. While they haven't confirmed their relationship, nor do they appear on social media together, the duo still remain photographed out and about, including at basketball games, restaurants, and on vacations, making it clear they're definitely still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on Feburary 8, 2022: </strong>Sydney Sweeney and Jonathan Davino are still together in 2022, and they will be celebrating their fourth anniversary sometime this year. While Sweeney is still trying to keep the relationship as private as ever, her fans have nevertheless formed all sorts of opinions about her beau. Some fans are upset about their thirteen-year age gap, while others are concerned about the <a href=#>various legal cases involving the pizza franchise that his family runs</a>.</p><p>Some fans are even <a href=#>upset that Sydney Sweeney is dating a man at all</a>; she has played queer characters and implied that she is bisexual in the past, so many fans have expressed that they want to see Sweeney date a woman. Despite all of her fans' opinions, Sweeney still seems to be very much in love with Davino, and she is surely happy to keep their relationship as private as ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-had-some-witty-responses-to-questions-about-her-love-life>Sydney Sweeney Had Some Witty Responses To Questions About Her Love Life</h2><p>Success doesn't just bring haters, it also brings eager fans who want to know every aspect of your life. Any celebrity can tell you that the number two thing the media covers about them is their love life. We care about their careers, obviously, but few stories sell better than romantic drama. So, it's really no surprise, given all of Sweeney's success, that some fans are watching her like a hawk <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to learn whatever they can about her man.</a></p><p>Back in November 2020, fans found out that Sweeney was no longer single. After the paparazzi published photos showing Sweeney with a mystery man engaging in some serious PDA on the beach, most fans were delighted. Others were quick to share their thoughts about Sweeney being taken off the market. One fan tweeted that the news of her new man shut down any thoughts of a happy Thanksgiving. "Sydney Sweeney has a man... Thanksgiving canceled," they wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweeney's reply was hysterical. She retweeted the comment along with a picture of herself and a friend at prom and wrote, "baby girl go have a feast. your girl at prom," with a winky face at the end. But this did nothing to stop people from talking about her love life. Was this her way of telling us she's part of the LGBTQ+ community? Once her response started trending on Twitter, some fans just took time to comment on how beautiful she is.</p><p>Before this, over quarantine, Sweeney intrigued fans when she adopted a dog named Tink. Of course, like any other dog owner, Sweeney posted tons of photos of herself with her new pup, but the weird thing was, how was she taking these photos? This led many fans to believe that she was quarantined with her mystery man unless she has a sick camera set up.</p><p>There have been other hints of a man on her Instagram. Who is she constantly cooking meals for and going out to eat with? Surely not herself?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Sydney Sweeney Is Launching Her Boyfriend's Career</a></span></p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-has-been-dating-jonathan-davino-since-2018>Sydney Sweeney Has Been Dating Jonathan Davino Since 2018</h2><p>Despite all of these hints and the PDA photos of the pair in Hawaii, there's been no confirmation of a relationship from the actress herself. According to some sources, the pair have been dating for years. They were seen a couple of times in 2018 at an InStyle and Kate Spade dinner in Los Angeles and the TAO Chicago Nightclub. On a trip to the Amalfi coast in 2019, she told Elite Daily that she was with "a friend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All we know about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davino is that he's a restaurateur</a> and heir to the pizza company Pompei, which opened in 1909. But besides this information, the man is virtually radio silent, with no known social media or anything else about him on the web. So far as we know, and that's not a lot, they're still together.</p><h2 id=jonathan-davino-is-nowhere-on-sydney-sweeney-39-s-social-media>Jonathan Davino Is Nowhere On Sydney Sweeney's Social Media</h2><p>While it appears as if Sweeney is still very much on board with keeping her romance a mystery, it's safe to say she's not giving in anytime soon. Despite the public wanting answers when it comes to her reported relationship, Sydney has managed to keep her social media completely clear of any signs of Jonathan.</p><p>The two continue to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted out and about with one another</a>, indicating that they are, in fact, still together. However, fans of the star would love some confirmation, whether it be in an Instagram post, or heck, even an Instagram Stories upload, we'd just be happy to witness their ongoing love story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Sweeney's 10 Best Instagram Outfits</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicrqiYpL%2BqrYyssJ2mla56tMPEnqWesV2osqS%2BxK1km6epm7%2Bqsc2dZKOnnpbBqa3NZpuarpmjvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
