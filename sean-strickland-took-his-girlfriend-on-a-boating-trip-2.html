It was unclear where exactly they were sailing, but judging by the picture, it seemed like they were on the water in some river.</p><p>Strickland has been doing great on the ring and off the ring with his personal life too. He is one of the top-ranked UFC fighters who compete in the middleweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p><p>The 31-year-old frequently makes internet headlines with his comments and actions. More recently, Strickland remarked on Alex Pereira’s emphatic victory over Israel Adesanya at UFC 281. He said after the fight, “Izzy, you should have wrestled.”</p><p>Strickland also addressed whether or not he believes the UFC should reverse the decision and give Adesanya an instant sequel with Pereira for the 185-pound championship.</p><h2 id=sean-strickland-took-his-girlfriend-on-a-boating-trip><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-strickland-took-his-girlfriend-on-a-boating-trip></span> Sean Strickland Took His Girlfriend On A Boating Trip<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sean Strickland took his Caucasian girlfriend out for a romantic boat trip on October 15, 2022. He posted the photo on his Instagram&nbsp;@strickland_mma_.</p><p>It was a lovely picture of the two cruising through the sunshine together. While she was wearing shorts and an orange knitted top with a jacket over it, he had gone topless.</p><p>Strickland even wrote a hilarious caption; ‘I said, “you like boats? wanna go for a ride?” She said, ” depends; how big?” “5ft 10 horsepower” Does size matter?!?”&nbsp;</p><p>Those who understood the context and reference commented on the picture. Sean’s fellow MMA fighter Johnny Elben made it to the comment box and seemed to find the joke laughable. “Bahahahahh nice.” He commented.</p><p>Another user made fun of him and other UFC fighters mockingly by claiming that even being UFC fighters, they still have to obey their girlfriend and take them shopping as “all regular men do.”</p><p>“One moment you a ufc fighter…next thing you know you shoppin for scented candles at Bath and Body Works.”</p><p>While others were optimistic about his romantic prospects and wished him well in his love endeavors. Besides, the MMA star did not reveal the name and identity of his mysterious girlfriend, and it remains an enigma.</p><h2 id=sean-strickland-had-his-girlfriend-stolen-from-him-by-dominick-cruz><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-strickland-had-his-girlfriend-stolen-from-him-by-dominick-cruz></span> Sean Strickland Had His Girlfriend Stolen From Him By Dominick Cruz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Last year, Sean Strickland dropped the bombshell that his ex-girlfriend was stolen from him by Dominick Cruz.</p><p>When Strickland spoke up about the time Dominick Cruz stole his girlfriend from him, he let the world in on his shame and shared it with everyone. He tweeted about the incident some 13 years ago and tagged MMA star, Dominick Cruz.</p><p>“@DominickCruz took a girl from me once man about 12 years ago… it happens to us all….” Tarzan wrote.</p><p>The former UFC King of the Cage said he did not have much familiarity with women at the time and blamed his lack of expertise on the fact that Cruz was able to steal the lady away from him.</p><p>Strickland continued to elaborate on what occurred more than a decade ago when he was in his late teens and starting his way out in the professional mixed martial arts career that he was not mature enough to know “how to handle that fine of a girl” at that time.</p><p>And Dominick Cruz, with all his experience, snatched his girl right in front of his eyes, and he was powerless to do anything about that. Sean also added it was long ago, and he has no grudge against Cruz.</p><h2 id=sean-strickland-past-relationships-and-dating-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-strickland-past-relationships-and-dating-life></span> Sean Strickland Past Relationships And Dating Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sean Strickland has dated several girls since his teenage years. None of his relationships lasted long.</p><p>To remind you, he is not single at the moment and has a beautiful girlfriend. But looking at his past and the previous relationship, there are not many, to be honest. He dated his personal trainer Holly back in 2018.</p><p>He had adorned the images of his girlfriend with endearing remarks and put them on his social media. It would seem that the two of them had a close relationship. In addition, during their holidays, they regularly traveled to breathtaking locations all over the globe.</p><p>But they broke up shortly after, and now, none of those pictures are available on his social media. Strickland also revealed some 12 years ago, his then-girlfriend cheated on him by having an affair with Dominick Cruz.</p><p>Moreover, early this year, the UFC fighter had online fun with an adult film star Karma RX. They flirted with each other on Twitter for a brief period.</p><p>It didn’t take long for MMA fans to figure out what Karma did for a living, and before she knew it, the adult film actress was being hounded by an overwhelming number of followers. Unfortunately, even though they had jested for a while, their conversation did not push further.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-sean-strickland-have-a-girlfriend></span>Does Sean Strickland have a girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Sean Strickland is not single and has a girlfriend.
