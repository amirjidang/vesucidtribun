The setting of the story and all the realistic details make it a joy to watch. People can't stop talking about it but there's more to the show than what you see at a glance. Here are ten behind-the-scenes facts about the show.</p><h2 id=easttown-is-a-real-place><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Easttown Is A Real Place</span></h2><p>Unlike a lot of films and movies that use settings based on made-up places, Easttown is a real location. It is a small town on the outskirts of Pennsylvania. It is home to about&nbsp;10,500 people and while the show makes the city look as if it is falling on hard times and the residents are unhappy, the real Easttown is much different. People love living in the small town and it has many jobs and opportunities for those who call it home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=local-foods-were-used-in-the-show><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Local Foods Were Used In The Show</span></h2><p>Product placement is often use in shows and movies and it was no different for this one. The big difference here is that many of the foods and drinks in the movie are actually from local places.&nbsp; <a href=#>Gas stations</a>, restaurants and other small businesses were also shown in the film and are actually real places that can be found in or around the real Easttown.</p><h2 id=winslet-s-hair-was-done-badly-on-purpose><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Winslet's Hair Was Done Badly On Purpose</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she has an extensive film list, most people think of Kate Winslet from the Titanic film. <a href=#>In Titanic she played a beautiful, rich young woman </a>who wore gorgeous gowns, expensive jewelry and has her hair and makeup always on point. Kate's character in Mare of Easttown looks much different. Because Kate is so striking, the hair and makeup team has to deliberately make her look rough to fit her character's appearance.</p><h2 id=a-cast-member-died-during-filming><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A Cast Member Died During Filming</span></h2><p>While there were a lot of deaths and murders in the storyline, there was also a real death during the filming of the show.&nbsp;Phyllis Somerville, who played&nbsp;Betty Carroll on the show passed away in her home of natural causes while product was put on hold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mare-s-character-is-based-on-a-real-life-police-detective><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mare's Character Is Based On A Real-Life Police Detective</span></h2><p>While the character Mare may be fictional, she was based on a real person.&nbsp; Christine Bleiler, a Chester County detective has a similar personality and spunk to her. In fact, Kate says that she was her inspiration for her character and she would often call and reach out to her for help with the role and to ask her how she would handle a situation or what she thought about her portrayal of the character.</p><p>Kate explained,&nbsp;“I would honestly call her at 5 in the morning and I’d say, ‘Christine, I’m so sorry. Are you awake?’</p><h2 id=winslet-had-never-held-a-gun-before-the-show><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Winslet Had Never Held A Gun Before The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Kate has played a lot of characters</a> over the years and had a lot of amazing life experiences, she had never even held a gun until she played Mare. She had to not only learn to hold it, but also learn how to aim and shoot so she could make the scenes look realistic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Penelope Cruz And Kate Winslet Fell Victim To Johnny Depp's Pranks</a></span></p><h2 id=evan-peters-was-also-filming-wandavision><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Evan Peters Was Also Filming&nbsp;<i>WandaVision&nbsp;</i></span></h2><p>Evan Peters was nailing to roles at once. Not only was he playing Detective Zabel on Mare of Easttown, but he was also filming WandaVision at the same time. It's can't be easy switching back and force between two different roles or putting in double time to be a part of both stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-show-s-creator-grew-up-near-easttown><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Show's Creator Grew Up Near Easttown</span></h2><p>While the show's creator didn't grow up in the town of Easttown, he did grow up right down to road in the town of Berwyn. While the story and events are not true, he did base many of the characters on people he knew growing up and the habits of small-town folk.</p><p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kate Winslet Captures Critic Attention In New HBO Limited Series 'Mare Of Easttown'</a></p><h2 id=winslet-lived-in-the-film-setting-for-a-month-to-get-a-feel-for-it><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Winslet Lived In The Film Setting For A Month To Get A Feel For It</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate really wanted to nail her role and she needed to <a href=#>find out what it was like to live</a> in the place that Mare would call home.
