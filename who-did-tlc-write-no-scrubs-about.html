For example, many of Eminem’s songs <a href=#>contain direct references</a> to some of the famous people he has interacted with, or he has a grudge against for one reason or another. On the other hand, there are some hit songs that people want to know more about years after they were first released. Most notably, “You're So Vain” came out in 1971, and people still want to know more about the men it is about to this day.</p><p>When TLC’s “No Scrubs” first became a massive hit, most people assumed that the song was about men who act a certain way in general. However, over the years, some fans came to believe that the song was actually about a certain celebrity, and TLC confirmed that idea to be true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/depositphotos_634445288_xl.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Surprising Facts Behind Some Of The Beatles' Most Famous Lyrics</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Not only are The Beatles responsible for some of the most popular songs ever recorded, lyrics they wrote are now part of our lexicon.</span><p><strong>Updated May 2024:</strong>In 2017, TLC released what they have called their final album. Neither Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins nor Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas have any interest in releasing a sixth album. However, they have not shut the door on releasing music another way, which is via a Broadway musical or play. And despite not releasing new music, that does not mean that the duo is not touring. In early 2024, T-Boz and Chilli appeared for several dates in Australia for the 30th anniversary of "CRAZYSEXYCOOL." What the future has for TLC remains to be seen.</p><h2 id=quot-no-scrubs-quot-became-a-huge-song>"No Scrubs" Became A Huge Song</h2><h3 id=quot-no-scrubs-quot-was-released-in-1999-and-spent-four-weeks-at-the-top-of-the-billboard-charts>"No Scrubs" was released in 1999 and spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard charts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tlc-girl-band-at-awards-show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When TLC’s “No Scrubs” was released as a single in 1999, it quickly became <strong>one of the most-talked-about songs in the world</strong>. While some of the attention that “No Scrubs” received was negative, due to some listeners taking offense to the way the song labels a certain kind of man, most people embraced it.</p><p>A worldwide hit that charted in twenty-one countries, in 1999, Billboard listed the song at number two on their year-end Hot 100 singles chart, and it <strong>topped the weekly Hot 100 for four weeks</strong>. Of course, both of those achievements are impressive feats, especially when you consider some popular singers have gone years without reaching the top spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.</p><p>On top of the Billboard achievements that “No Scrubs” recieved, the song pulled off several other notable feats. For example, the music video for “No Scrubs” won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. On top of that, “No Scrubs” was played so much on the radio that it was named the <strong>Top Airplay song of 1999</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=origins-of-quot-no-scrubs-quot>Origins Of "No Scrubs"</h2><h3 id=dave-coulier-was-the-inspiration-for-the-song-quot-no-scrubs-quot>Dave Coulier was the inspiration for the song "No Scrubs"</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar44151293-1.jpg><p>Over the years, there were some rumors about “No Scrubs” being about the behavior of one person in particular. In 2020, the two surviving members of TLC confirmed that, as some people had come to believe, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the song is about Full House’s Dave Coulier</a>. During an interview in which she was accompanied by Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas spoke about the moment that inspired “No Scrubs”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“One day we’re out walking, and [Coulier] and Stamos come driving by, and you know, Coulier leans out and tries to holler at us from the passenger side of the car. To be honest, I didn’t know who he was at first — I just saw a bunch of hair and a bright, patterned shirt, but then it clicked and I was like, ‘Is that that corny mother***er, Uncle Joey?’ So I started jotting down some lines, and the rest is history. He was talking like Popeye for some reason, and had this beaver puppet… that part didn’t make it in the song.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/full-house-cast-members-john-stamos-and-dave-coulier-both-battled-brutal-secret-health-issues-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Full House Cast Members John Stamos And Dave Coulier Both Battled Secret Health Issues</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>John Stamos and Dave Coulier, beloved for playing Uncle Jesse and Uncle Joey on Full House, have both had heartbreaking health struggles.</span><h2 id=dave-coulier-has-a-pattern-of-behavior>Dave Coulier Has A Pattern Of Behavior</h2><h3 id=dave-coulier-was-also-the-inspiration-for-alanis-morissette-39-s-song-quot-you-oughta-know-quot>Dave Coulier was also the inspiration for Alanis Morissette's song, "You Oughta Know"</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-coulier-revealed-the-one-detail-that-convinced-him-alanis-morissette-wrote-you-oughta-know-about-their-relationship-front-instar-back-commons-licences-1.jpg><p>When most people learn that “No Scrubs” was written about Dave Coulier, they are bound to think of another song that is widely believed to be about the Full House actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released in 1995, Alanis Morissette’s “You Oughta Know” was a massive hit that played a pivotal role in the Canadian singer becoming <a href=#>a wealthy musical legend</a>. Lyrically speaking, “You Oughta Know” paints a picture of a young woman’s anger at the way a man who she was romantically linked to treated her.</p><p>Over the years, many interviewers have asked Alanis Morissette to identify the man who inspired the particularly rage-filled “You Oughta Know” lyrics. However, Morissette has always taken the high road by dodging those questions. Despite Morissette’s classy decision not to call anyone out by name, at times Dave Coulier has admitted to being the man who inspired those lyrics, amazingly enough.</p><p>During a HuffPost Live interview, <a href=#>Dave Coulier talked about realizing</a> that “You Oughta Know” was about him after <strong>one lyric in particular</strong>. “We had already broken up… She called and I said, ‘Hey, you know, I’m right in the middle of dinner.
