I mean, just 10 years ago you were sleeping in your car,” the host, Tracy Smith, said.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. And, like, woo, staying in people's rooms and sleeping on their couches,” Lizzo replied.</p><p>"And now, on this past tour, which I was blessed to, you know, stay in really nice places,” she continued. “But I was like, 'I miss my house. Like, I can't wait to come back to my own home and to my bed.' And I was like, 'This is the first time I've ever said this.' So, I don't know. It's a milestone for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Lizzo purchased the property in October</a> from Warner Bros. CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck. The businessman originally bought it from Sam Gnatovich and Alexi Rennalls, thus husband and wife duo behind SIMO design.</p><p>The couple originally bought the property from Harry Styles, who owned it from 2014 to 2016, before doing a complete overall of the existing structure. They upgraded to a Modernist treehouse-inspired home.</p><p>The home is as spacious as its price tag, with over 5,300 square feet of living space, which includes 3 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms.</p><p>Lizzo also opened up about her newly purchased home in her HBO documentary Love, Lizzo, which debuted in November.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>The place it holds is trauma</a>. Traumatic experiences, man. But they also propelled me and got me out of — I didn't want to stay there,” she explained. “I had to evolve, I had to grow, I had to get better. I don't think about it often, but recently I thought about it a lot where I'm having this full-circle moment of like, wow, I'm in my house that I've purchased and I'm watching this documentary about my life, talking about when I was sleeping in my car and on Thanksgiving.”</p><p>The singer continued, “It's very cyclical and full-circle. This is also the first time I've owned a house and loved where I've lived. Two years ago I was in a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Echo Park. And then I had like a rental house as of December 2019. But this is really being a grown-up. I feel like I got my big-girl pants on and I feel like this is a new place for me, actually feeling safe in the space that I'm occupying.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, “So it's a big deal. It's something worth celebrating, for sure.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lamar Odom Rents $15,000/Month Mansion Near Ex Khloe Kardashian</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Suburban</a>, <a href=#>AD</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaloaqvvG6vxKWcm6qRqbK0ecGusKKml2K7psOMppinq5mku26txa2cq2WcnsOqusZmoKdlmJq%2Fbq%2FAq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
