“It took me all the way to now to say something because I didn’t want to believe it was real but this was a mutual decision to take a step back in our relationship and just be friends for now,” Korey captioned a photo of the pair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I realized I can be vulnerable again and truly care for someone. When <a href=#>we were on love island everything was perfect</a> and I can say that was honestly the happiest moment of my life. Unfortunately that’s not real life and In the real world we’re now faced with real world challenges. Some that we couldn’t overcome.”</p><p>The Virginia native called his ex “one of the most <a href=#>beautiful people I’ve ever met</a> inside and out,” noting that they have respect for one another and feel grateful that they were able to experience the show together.</p><p>“But our journeys unfortunately have to go in separate directions for now. I love everyone of y’all so I can only hope we’ll receive the same amount of support as individuals,” he added.</p><p>The following day, Korey’s Love Island costar Kyra, 24, revealed that she split from Will, 26.</p><p>“There has been a lot of speculation regarding my relationship status recently. I have been taking time for myself, until I was ready to make things public,” Kyra wrote via her Instagram Story. “I feel that I owe you all an explanation because I would not be where I am without the Love Island supporters. I am single and have been working through the stages of heartbreak and healing. There are no words to explain how grateful I am for the love and support I’ve received since certain instances have come to light. Love you all.”</p><p>Will did not comment on the split but last shared photos with Kyra on Halloween as the duo wore matching Pulp Fiction costumes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One couple from the season, who paired up on day one, is <strong>Shannon St. Clair</strong> and <strong>Josh Goldstein</strong>.
