Her character with the ultra girly, fashion-forward friend in a group of four, who struggle to find out what happened to their friend Alison after she suspiciously disappears. The show, which ran from 2009-2017, was met with much critical acclaim and success. Ashley has been nominated for a variety of awards and nominations for her work on the series; she has won a four Teen Choice Awards, a Young Hollywood Award, a Youth Rock Award, and has been nominated for multiple other Teen Choice Awards, People’s Choice Awards, and MTV Movie Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since kissing PLL goodbye, Ashley has been featured in a variety of projects that have only worked to increase her star power. She’s made various appearances on well-known TV shows throughout the years, including Punk’d, How I Met Your Mother, the PLL-spinoff Ravenswood, Family Guy, and Barely Famous. In 2010, the celeb starred in the made-for-TV movie Christmas Cupid alongside Christina Milian and Chad Michael Murray. In 2013, she was cast in the highly anticipated flick Spring Breakers, which co-starred James Franco, Vanessa Hudgens, and Selena Gomez. Since then, she has also starred in a handful of other movies, including Ratter (2015), Pixels (2015), Elvis & Nixon (2016), Chronically Metropolitan (2017), and she will star in Her Smell, which is due for release in 2019.</p><p>Aside from her work in show business, Ashley has also been adored her for edgy yet fashion-forward style on and off the red carpet. Check out these 25 outfits that will prove that Ashley has amazing style, and will definitely make you miss her face in PLL even more!</p><h2 id=blue-eyed-and-beautiful>blue-eyed and beautiful</h2><p>Ashley’s character Hanna on Pretty Little Liars was known for her feminine, fashion-forward sense of style. Though Ashley is equally chic in real life, she’s got more of an edgy, rock n’ roll vibe to her style, as evidenced by this all-black outfit. The actress paired a basic leather jacket with a black turtleneck and dark skinny jeans for an A-list event. Her gorgeous baby blues stood out against the dark outfit, while her tousled short ‘do add to the edginess of the look. The silver detailing of her jacket and belt completed the look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I had a gothic phase, and now I'm more edgy chic,” the singer has said of her dark sense of style, emphasizing that she’s gone through even edgier phases in her life.</strong></p><p>"My all-time fave is Saint Laurent,” she’s also said of her favourite brands and style icons. “I'd wear it 24/7 if I could. Or The Row; I love how Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen mix masculine with feminine." Just like Hanna, Ashley sure has a knack for designer items and putting together stylish outfits. Who knows, maybe she’ll eventually have a career in fashion just like her character did. We know we’d love to shop her own clothing line!</p><h2 id=bringing-back-the-blazer>Bringing Back The Blazer</h2><p>Ashley showed off her edgy side in this dark outfit that she rocked on the red carpet a few years ago. The star showed up in a black, brocade dress with a sheer tea-length hem that revealed her long, toned legs. Ashley balanced off the amount of skin she was showing by throwing an oversized blazer on top of her shoulders. Her smokey makeup added to the edginess of the dark look, while her silver accessories and heeled sandals kept the look sophisticated. The star opted for a sleek, straight-down hairstyle that didn’t compete with her busy dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I like edgy but classic looks - like Chanel mixed with Alexander McQueen. My personal style is edgier,” the celeb has said of her style, which is perfectly emulated in this stunning look.</strong></p><p>“My closet is just black, gray, and white. I'm more comfortable in darker colors and leather jackets.” It’s true that you’ll scarcely see Hanna in bright colours, or really anything that isn’t a variation of white or black. But the celeb perfectly pulls off her darker sense of style, and it’s making us want to try out all-black outfits once&nbsp;in a while. Ashley is proof that you don’t need to rock colour in order to be fashion-forward!</p><h2 id=just-a-touch-of-fur>Just A Touch Of Fur</h2><p>Not only does Ashley have an incredible sense of red carpet fashion, but her street style is equally as enviable. The celeb is often pictured dressed-up in fashionable outfits even on days when she’s not needed on set or on the red carpet. Take this look as an example! Ashley must have been feeling a bit dramatic since she opted for a big, black furry jacket. She kept the rest of her look simple by styling the statement piece with dark, ripped jeans, a pair of leather booties, and celeb-worthy sunglasses. We want to look this good on our days off!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“When I was in LA, I dressed like I was in New York all the time, so moving here just allowed me to get more into the New York vibe with faux fur and cool jackets,” Ashley has said of her love for New York street fashion, which undeniably influenced this cool look.</strong></p><p>“Here, I wear cool, heavy jackets, turtlenecks and sneakers because I’m walking around a lot,” she added. “I like Converse or Nikes. I’m mostly in workout clothes when I’m in LA or jeans and a t-shirt. My style is not that fun to talk about. I wish it was.”</p><h2 id=the-darker-side-of-floral>The Darker Side Of Floral</h2><p>Ashley jumped on the dark floral bandwagon when she rocked this chic frock on the red carpet. The star stayed true to her love of darker colours by going for a floral print against a black background, and that incorporated deeper versus brighter colours. The lace on the sleeves and tea-length hem gave this dress a vintage, tea-party feel. Ashley kept the look fresh and trendy by styling her ombre hair in a loose, straight look, and opting for smoky makeup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have always questioned the celeb as to how she keeps her bright, blonde hair healthy. Seriously, when has Ashley ever had a bad hair day? The celeb admits that there’s a lot of work that goes into taking care of her mane.</p><p><strong>“Because I have to color it, it puts so much stress on your hair, so I’d go home and put a hair mask on for like 3 days so my hair can chill for a minute,” she once explained.</strong></p><p>“Even having to do your hair every day on set damages your hair and breaks your hair off. So I try not to do it as much as I can and just put it back in a bun with conditioner.”</p><h2 id=feeling-that-teenage-spirit>Feeling That Teenage Spirit</h2><p>Ashley proved she can rock a band t-shirt like no other when she stepped out in this funky look. The star paired a Kurt Cobain of Nirvana fame t-shirt with a furry, leopard print coat. Her bright red Yves Saint Laurent bag added a pop of colour to the monotone outfit, while her black skinny jeans perfectly blended into the edgy look. Ashley chose to keep the rest of her look toned down, opting for loosely curled waves and a natural makeup look. We can officially say that we’re obsessed!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the star has had great style moments on the red carpet, she admits that she prefers to be laid back when it comes to her style.</p><p><strong>“I love good old-fashioned black or white Converse,” Ash once said of her go-to pair of shoes. “I have a few pairs. And they are all really dirty. I can't have clean Converse - I go in the dirt and run around!”</strong></p><p>The celeb has also added that she loves it when her man has a similar sense of style as she does. Who doesn’t, right? “I love guys who know how to dress,” she explained. “I love the motorcycle boots, and I love the skinnier jeans with jackets and scarves. Anybody who gets his clothes at All Saints, that's my guy.”</p><h2 id=stealing-the-show-in-sequins>Stealing The Show In Sequins</h2><p>Ashley showed off her hourglass curves in this eye-catching sequin dress, which was flattering on both the front and rear view. The star’s assets were on full display in the gown, which featured a strapless, black bodice and a gold sequin skirt, which complimented her blonde locks. Ashley styled her hair in a vintage-inspired up-do, and went for a pop of red on her lips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to her busy schedule as an actress, Ashley has admitted that she never go to go to a prom or dance in high school, which is part of what makes dressing up for the red carpet so much fun for her.</p><p><strong>“I've never been to a prom or a dance,” she once explained. “So it's funny, because we have dances on the show, and I'll be like, 'Oh yay! It's my school dance!'”</strong></p><p>As for how she feels confident enough to wear such steamy dresses, Ashley says we just have to learn to accept that people will say hurtful things no matter what. The most important thing is being comfortable enough with yourself that you don’t let those sorts of things get to you! “People will make mean comments,” Ash once said. “People are going to say that you're fat, that you're this, that you're that. You just have to be comfortable in your own skin.”</p><h2 id=go-grunge-or-go-home>Go Grunge Or Go Home</h2><p>Ashley was at her best when she wore this grunge-inspired black dress to an A-list event. The figure-hugging frock showed off the star’s toned physique and stunning hourglass figure. The mesh paneling at the top and faux turtleneck design were right on trend, while the straight-down silhouette was very reminiscent of the ‘90s. Ashley gave the look a modern twist with a silver, sparkly clutch and a sophisticated, curled ‘do. This look makes us want to go back 20 years so that we can enjoy the grunge era in all of its glory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley is no stranger to switching up her style, and she admits to loving having tons of options of what to wear. But there’s one thing that the star is never seen without- her Cartier ring!</p><p><strong>“I'm always wearing my Cartier Love ring—it's so elegant and simple,” the celebrity explained.</strong></p><p>“An ex gave it to me three years ago, and since they aged my character, Hanna, on Pretty Little Liars up five years, it's believable that she would have one—so they let me wear it while shooting." Not many people like wearing jewelry that their exes gave them, so this must be a pretty important ring!</p><h2 id=trying-out-teal>Trying Out Teal</h2><p>Ashley took a huge style risk when she stepped out in this flattering teal power suit. The suit was perfectly cut to fit the star’s petite figure. The plunging neckline added a bit of steaminess to the dramatic look, while Ashley’s assortment of silver rings and smokey makeup edged it up. She finished the look off with a sleek hairstyle and a pair of smart, black pumps.&nbsp;The star has admitted to gravitating towards many different styles throughout the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“When I was younger, I went through a lot of different phases. One day I'd be punk rock, and the next I would be tomboyish, and then I would be really girly,” she once explained of her adventurous sense of fashion.</strong></p><p>“I was so weird. My two best friends and I were just crazy and goofy!”&nbsp;The celeb has also said that one of her favourite looks on women is a good old power suit- they’re not just for the boys anymore! "More laid-back. But when I do dress up, I really go for it. I like a suit look on a girl,” she once said. And after seeing Ashley rock this gorgeous teal suit, we couldn’t agree anymore! Do you?</p><h2 id=just-add-flannel>Just Add Flannel</h2><p>Even on days when she’s just dressing casual, Ashley proves that she has amazing style! The actress never looked better than when she stepped out in this punk-rock look. The celeb was wearing a white Nirvana band t-shirt underneath her leather jacket. She added a pair of denim shorts and tied a blue flannel around her waist for an extra bit of edginess. Her studded clutch, sunglasses, and dark headband add to the edgy but cool vibe of this look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I can always wear my leather jacket, which I wore almost every day in LA — even if it was 90 degrees outside, I’d still be in a leather jacket,” Ashley has said of her love for all things leather, especially her favourite jacket!</strong></p><p>The star credits her edgy-chic sense of style to her love of New York. “I think New York style is so cool and effortless,” she has said. “One of my favorite things is walking around and seeing everybody’s style — people are very fashion forward here. Brooklyn surprisingly is super-cool and young and has great fashion. The East Village has great fashion.” Given how Ashley looks both on and off the red carpet, we’d say she’s definitely meant for New York fashion!</p><h2 id=just-a-touch-of-drama>Just A Touch Of Drama</h2><p>Ashley has a thing for rocking cocktail dresses and pantsuits on the red carpet. So, it was a refreshing surprise when the star decided to rock a full-length gown to this red carpet event. True to her style, the actress kept the colours of the frock dark to give it an edgy vibe. The dark blue pattern on the dress’s skirt brought out the light blue in Ashley’s eyes, while the plunging neckline showed off her assets. The singer kept the look a bit more low-key with her loose up-do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, you can typically find Ashley instagramming her gorgeous outfits from the night before. But the star admits she wasn’t always a fan of social media, and got into it primarily because of her work. Still, the star admits that its tough ignoring the negativity and hate that comes through the media and Internet, even though she’s doing her best.</p><p><strong>“I feel like I never really cared about that stuff,” Ashley once explained.</strong></p><p>“The reason I do now is because of social media. It’s really important that young girls who watch our show know that it’s OK to not be perfect. I frequently talk about it — I’m not a size 0. I’m fine with the way I look.”</p><h2 id=she-needs-no-filter>she needs no filter</h2><p>Can we just take a moment to appreciate how flawless Ashley always looks? The actress’ makeup was on point when she walked the red carpet in this shimmery gown, which brought out the blue tones in her eyes. Her blonde hair was effortlessly styled and framed her face perfectly. This photo looks more like a Photoshopped picture from a magazine rather than a candid shot, which proves just how beautiful Ashley is. This girl needs no filters!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite how gorgeous her makeup always looks, Ashley hasn’t been afraid to admit that she knows zero about applying her own makeup!</p><p><strong>“Shay hasn’t learned anything from me because I don’t know how to do my makeup,” Ashley once said about how her PLL co-star Shay Mitchel has tried to teach her the basics of makeup applications.</strong></p><p>“But she’s tried to teach me to put lashes on, which I’m so bad at.” Ashley continued, “She’s put my lashes on before, and she taught me how to contour. My lashes would come out so crooked and upside down and she’d be like, ‘Ash its so easy!’ And I’m like, ‘Shay literally I can’t I don’t know what’s going on but it doesn’t work.”</p><h2 id=go-bold-in-black>Go Bold In Black</h2><p>Ashley proves that a black look doesn’t have to be boring! The actress looked edgy in this all-black outfit. The criss-cross cutout showed off her toned stomach, while the high waisted pants highlighted her long legs and slim figure. Ashley kept her hair sleek in tousled waves, while she added a hint of pink to her lips and cheek to give her look a bit more of a feminine vibe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley hasn’t been afraid to admit she’s had to overcome a lot of insecurities and criticism to get where she is today, especially thanks to working in the acting business.</p><p><strong>“Whatever you look like, you’re never going to be good enough for them, and they’re always going to say something. It’s usually negative,” the celeb has said about how she feels like haters are unavoidable.</strong></p><p>The only thing you can do is make sure you rise above it!</p><p>The star added that most celebs don’t look how they do in photos in actual, normal life. “Most of the time, those photos are Photoshopped. You can make yourself five pounds less,” Ashley said. “It’s important for girls to accept who they are and be confident in themselves because if they’re not, that sucks. It’s important to talk about.”</p><h2 id=thinking-out-of-the-box>Thinking Out Of The Box</h2><p>Ashley cut a new silhouette when she stepped out in this boxy dress. She looked totally chic and fashion-forward in the unique, black dress that featured a tea-length hemline and fraying at the bottom. Ashley added a much-needed pop of colour with a pair of red stilettos, which featured an adorable bow on the back. Talk about finishing details! Ashley pulled her hair back in a sleek ponytail; so all eyes were on her sophisticated outfit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley always seems like a pro on the red carpet and during appearances, which is probably because she knew she wanted to be an actress since she was a kid!</p><p><strong>“When I was little I used to dance and model and that was fun,” she once recalled. “But I was always the person that was goofing off and I would memorize every line in every movie that I saw. And at recess that's what I would do, I would talk to my friends and recite movies.”</strong></p><p>Since she grew up in Hollywood, Ashley admits that there was a lot of temptation to stray when she was younger- but she never took the bait. “I've seen a lot of people - for example, Lindsay Lohan - who got into the wrong crowd”, she said. “I always have my eye on what I want. And I don't want anything to distract me from that.”</p><h2 id=perfect-in-peplum>Perfect In Peplum</h2><p>Ashley looked incredible in a figure-hugging white dress that she wore to an event honoring Pretty Little Liars in 2014. The peplum detailing in her white frock added a modern yet edgy twist to the classic dress, while the star’s tousled hair and smoky eye makeup offered even more edginess to the feminine look. Ashley finished the sophisticated look with an assortment of silver earrings and rings to give it a street-style finish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley has become a household name thanks to her starring role in PLL. But the star has always been adamant that she has big dreams for her acting career – and it sounds like a TV show is only the start of it.</p><p><strong>“This sounds crazy, but my goal is to be nominated for an Oscar. I was the kid who was practicing my acceptance speech when I was ten,” Ashley once said, explaining her dream.</strong></p><p>She continued, “I love Michelle Williams and Natalie Portman - those are the careers I want. My goal is to win an Oscar, and I'm going to take the steps to get there.”</p><p>So far, Ashley admits that she isn’t always getting cast in the roles she wants, and is hoping to expand her repertoire in the future. “I always get offered the pretty, popular girl roles,” she explained. “But I want to do something dark, really challenge myself and get out of my comfort level.”</p><h2 id=going-a-bit-more-girly>Going A Bit More Girly</h2><p>Ashley left the leather and black clothing at home when she stepped out in this ultra-feminine dress. The beige frock featured gorgeous lace detailing on the top and a flirt keyhole slip that showed off some serious cleavage. The gorgeous dress’s bottom featured ruffles and layering, which only added to the girly-girl vibes we’re getting from this look. Ashley kept the romantic theme going by styling her blonde locks in loose waves and going for pink-toned makeup. She’s never looked better!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Ashley an incredible style role model, but it turns out she’s a great role model in general, too. The star hasn’t been afraid to talk about the temptations of Hollywood, and how she’s always been resolved to avoid them, so that they don’t affect her career.</p><p><strong>“In Hollywood, there is a lot of pressure to do certain things and getting into alcohol, or partying a lot is a major one,” the actress has explained.</strong></p><p>“I stay out of that, because it is a waste of my time. I always remember where I came from and to never change who I am - I stick to my morals, and I do not let anyone pressure me into doing things that I do not want to.”</p><h2 id=a-dress-fit-for-a-queen>A Dress Fit For A Queen</h2><p>Ashley looked like she was taking inspiration from the Royal Family when she stepped out in this over-the-top floral dress. The large skirt overpowered the star’s petite frame, but the dark floral detailing made the gown fashion-forward and gave it an edgy twist. Ashley kept the rest of her look sophisticated, with a simple, chic up-do and a double strand of pearls. The star kept her hands in her pockets as she posed for photos on the red carpet. Yes, that’s right. Her dress had pockets! That’s when you know you’ve found the winning look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although we’re used to seeing Ashley in edgier, often darker looks, the star says she’s gone through a lot of phases when it comes to her style – including a girly one, as evidenced by this daring red carpet dress.</p><p><strong>“When I was younger, I went through a lot of different phases,” she has explained.</strong></p><p>“One day I’d be punk rock, and the next I would be tomboyish, and then I would be really girly. I was so weird. My two best friends and I were just crazy and goofy!” Clearly having an experimental sort of style has worked out for Ashley, because she always looks stylish in whatever she’s wearing!</p><h2 id=playing-with-the-boys>Playing With The Boys</h2><p>Ashley definitely wears her fair share of dresses. But the star is also a fan of rocking a good pair of trousers on the red carpet! The actress had never looked better than when she stepped out in this menswear-inspired look, which featured a flattering pair of dark, high-waisted pants and a pale blue shirt. Though this outfit seems a bit too business causal for a Hollywood event on paper, the star made sure to edge it up with her tousled hairstyle and deeply, unbuttoned V-neck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley’s masculine outfit might be inspired by the fact that most of the people she hangs out with are guys! The celeb has said in the past that she has more guy friends than girlfriends, and has always seemed to get along with boys better.</p><p><strong>“I have one good girlfriend and then most of my friends are guys,” she once explained.</strong></p><p>“Which I love, because they're just like so easygoing and I love to play like Xbox and just chill out when I'm not working, so boys are probably the way to go for me.” Clearly, Ashley is using her masculine influence to inspire her red carpet outfits, and its definitely working. You go girl!</p><h2 id=a-denim-distraction>a denim distraction</h2><p>We bet all eyes were on Ashley as she was caught strolling the street in this chic denim look. One of the number one rules of fashion says not to pair denim with denim, but clearly, Ash knows that rules are meant to be broken! She opted for a light wash, oversized jean jacket on top of equally ripped skinny jeans for a chic, street style look. The actress added a pop of color with her bright red Yves Saint Laurent bag, and the subtle leopard print pattern on her boots. Ashley kept her hair down and messy, while she hid her famous face away in a pair of round sunglasses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After photos were public of Ashley in this outfit, many fans were scrambling to find where she’d purchased her adorable shoes from. The celeb has admitted to loving shoes on more than one occasion.</p><p><strong>"These Balenciaga boots are one of my favorite pairs of shoes,” she said of her favorite footwear during an interview once.</strong></p><p>“I also have them in silver and gold— I'll pair them with a plain tee and shorts or jeans.” Ashley added, “They're just fun, and I always feel good in them." The right pair of shoes can change any outfit!</p><h2 id=leather-can-be-girly-too>Leather Can Be Girly, Too</h2><p>Ashley has never hidden her love for leather. But the actress proved that the edgy material can be feminine if you want it to be! Instead of opting for her typical grungy, leather looks, Ashley opted for a girly pink leather skirt to wear to this Hollywood event. She paired the flattering skirt with a purple V-neck tank top, and a pair of mauve heels with an intricate design. The star kept her look basic but opting for a casual ponytail and minimal accessories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On how she’s becoming so daring with her fashion choices, Ashley has said that working in Hollywood has made her a lot more confident about her body.</p><p><strong>“I was in a bathing suit every single day [while filming Spring Breakers]. It definitely made me more confident,” the star has said about body positivity.</strong></p><p>“We had to do a bathing suit scene for PLL. The girls were like, ‘Oh my god, I don’t want to be in a bathing suit on screen!’ and I was like, ‘Whatever. Come on, throw it on me.’ It is what it is! People will make mean comments. People are going to say that you’re fat, that you’re this, that you’re that. You just have to be comfortable in your own skin.” You go, girl!</p><h2 id=feeling-a-little-flirty>Feeling A Little Flirty</h2><p>Ashley opted for a super girly-girl look when she hit up this red carpet event! The actress was adorable in a ruched, cream mini-dress, which featured a flirty bow detailing and high-neckline. The actress matched her accessories to the gold and black in her dress, and finished the feminine look with a high bun. Ashley made sure to smile sweetly on the red carpet as she stopped for photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing fans have always been envious about&nbsp;in concerns of Ashley is her glowing, clear skin. The star never seemed to have a bad skin day on Pretty Little Liars, even though she was barely finished being a teen when she started filming the hit show. Despite having such flawless skin, Ashley admits that she doesn’t do anything in particular to maintain her complexion.</p><p><strong>“My skin is really sensitive, so I don't use too much on it,” she once explained.</strong></p><p>“I'm actually really bad at washing my face. I get so lazy at night so I usually buy the Neutrogena wipes and it gets all the makeup off and it’s easy and that's the way to go. I hate washing my face, so I always use the wipes.” That’s totally a lazy girl’s beauty hack!</p><h2 id=she-s-living-for-lace>She's Living For Lace</h2><p>More than often, lace is associated with more feminine, classic looks… not the rock n’ roll vibes that Ashley often goes for. But the celeb proves that lace can be edgy when she showed up to an event in this stunning, deep purple dress. The cocktail dress featured delicate lace sheering throughout the whole frock. The bodice was completely sheer, and Ashley’s bralette was visible underneath, adding to the steamy vibes of this look. She edged up the look even more with edgy eye makeup, a black manicure, and black stilettos. This is by far one of her best looks!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashley has said that playing the character Hanna on Pretty Little Liars has made her more adventurous with her style, and open to mixing designers pieces into her edgy wardrobe.</p><p><strong>“My character, Hanna, has always dressed super, super girly,” the celeb once explained.</strong></p><p>“But recently, they've been putting me in designers like Chanel and Givenchy. It's opened me up to wearing fancier things during the day. I'm going to ask for everything when the show ends!" We would totally die if we got to dress up in designer duds all day for our work. We can see why Ashley has developed such a love for fashion!</p><h2 id=when-punk-is-made-pretty>When Punk Is Made Pretty</h2><p>Ashley was a grunge goddess when she stepped out in this dramatic look. The celeb was clearly taking inspiration from the grungy ‘90s. She threw on an oversized, furry leopard coat on top of a basic white t-shirt and skinny jeans. Her black booties, messy hair, and cherry red lipstick only added to the edgy vibes of this bold look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Above all, we love that Ashley is always true to herself! The star isn’t afraid to wear what she wants whenever, or to be real with her fans on social media.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;“I’ve always been super open with posting pictures on Instagram or Snapchat with pimple cream everywhere, because I think its super cool to tell them, ‘Hey everybody goes through it,’” Ashley once explained about why she likes to be as transparent as possible for her fans.</strong></p><p>She continued, “I don’t really wear makeup outside of work because my skin is super sensitive to it, so if I’m working 16 or 18 hours on the show or doing events or red carpets, it’s really harsh on my skin,” she added. “So every time I’m working a lot, I tend to break out more, but this product has helped a lot.”</p><h2 id=feeling-fresh-in-floral>feeling fresh in floral</h2><p>Ashley was absolutely glowing in summery sundress during this Hollywood event. Her white floral dress incorporated hints of pink, yellow, and green, and the actress expertly matched her Chanel bucket bag to the frock. The starlet kept her makeup au natural, and tucked her loosely curled hair behind her ears with a pair of sunglasses. Ashley made sure to flash a big smile for the onlooking cameras as she made her way to the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing Ashley’s fans have always noticed is that the celeb, though she loves to wear figure-hugging and sometimes risqué pieces, never bares too much on the red carpet. The star has explained that she’s not the biggest fan of nudity, and would rather have a little something covering her up than nothing.</p><p><strong>“I never want to do nudity that’s gratuitous. Girls look so much better in lingerie or a t-shirt and leave the rest up to the imagination,” the star once said.</strong></p><p>“I make it clear that I have a line. Everyone tries to push you, and it’s easy to get talked into doing those things. I’ll just walk off-set. But not everyone realizes they can do that.” We love that she’s not afraid to stick to her guns!</p><h2 id=simplicity-is-the-key>simplicity is the key</h2><p>Ashley looked like she was wearing something fit for royalty when she stepped out in this flattering crème dress. The off-the-shoulder neckline highlighted her toned shoulders and arm, while the A-line cut showed off the actress’ petite figure. The light beige color of the dress complimented the star’s blonde hair, which was effortlessly styled in look curls. Ashley completed the look by adding some sophisticated jewelry and a pair of light brown heels. She sure does clean up well!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Ashley loves to stray true to her edgy style, this outfit is proof that she also enjoys experimenting and mixing things up. The celeb’s advice is to always try out something new, but make sure that what you’re wearing is something you feel comfortable in.</p><p><strong>"Take a risk once in a while—why not? But try to wear things you feel comfortable in. If you're not, it will show, especially in pictures."</strong></p><p>As for what Ashley feels the most herself in? Anything that is true to her New York-inspired street style. "I dress like I should be living in New York: boots, leather jackets, sweaters, coats,” she once said. Well, that has amounted to a pretty killer sense of style, if these photos are any evidence.</p><h2 id=the-effortless-effect>The Effortless Effect</h2><p>Ashley looked steamy in this silky little number. For the iHeartRadio Awards, the actress walked the red carpet in a light beige silky dress, with a serious plunging neckline. The billowy fabric elegantly draped over her figure, while the high slit showed off her toned legs. The star kept the rest of her look simple with a pair of nude heels and silver jewelry. Her long, blonde hair was left down in a tousled, wavy style that added to the effortless look of this whole outfit, while her makeup was left clean and au natural.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have always marveled at how classy and put-together Ashley always looks on the red carpet. But the celeb wants fans to know that she’s not really this glamorous in real life- its all thanks to her talented beauty team!</p><p><strong>“Everything I do is unfabulous. I’m the most normal person,” Ashley said in describing what she’s like IRL.</strong></p><p>“I love walking everywhere, and going to hole-in-the-wall places, like nail shops, because they do the best job. And I go to vintage stores rather than high-end boutiques, because I like to dress different from other people.” Who else thinks she sounds like a carbon copy of Hanna from PLL?</p><p>Quotes: <a href=#>BrainyQuotes&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwfpRmp6Kbo2K8p3nArJ%2Blnalir6a60qilZqyYlsFuucCknGato2K6qr%2FSZqelpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
