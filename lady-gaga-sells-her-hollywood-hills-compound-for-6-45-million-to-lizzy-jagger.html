The House of Gucci star has sold the property off-the-market deal with model and activist Lizzy Jagger.

The property has porthole windows, and the doors throughout the home are salvaged from vintage submarines. The house is not publicly listed, making everyone clueless whether Lady Gaga made some minor or major renovations and changes. The singer, however, stated that the house is special and magical in her interview with Howard Stern. Gaga also said that she wanted to restore the place and leave it the way it is. Gaga also mentioned that when she bought the estate, the deal included Zappa’s personal soundboard on his recording studio. However, whether she also had Zappa’s soundboard on her deal with Jagger is not clear.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lady Gaga Dognapper Tried To Claim $500k Reward Before Being Indicted</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tudor-style main house has six bedrooms with five bathrooms plus the attached staff apartments. The house featured two recording studios when Lady Gaga purchased it; however, it is unclear if she kept both recording studios while living there. Reports say that Lady Gaga finished most of her Chromatica album in the studio. The house also has a skylit kitchen which is fitted with a breakfast island, stainless steel appliance and white cabinets. There is also a formal dining room that can cater to essential guests and a living room with a stunning fireplace. Additional amenities include a rooftop tennis court, mosaic art lined up in the gardens and a backyard swimming pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the singer has stayed in numerous rented apartments in her home city, New York, she is currently primarily based on the West Coast nowadays and her main home is the palatial oceanfront Malibu estate where she stays most of the time. The said property was bought for a hefty $22.5 million and became Gaga’s property in 2014.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gucci Looking For A Brand Boost With Lady Gaga & Adam Driver</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Observer,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5orDYZp6an5FiwKa4y6xkoZ2iYrWwuMuyrqinlGK1qrjLrGScp52lvLa6w2adqKpda3p1gYymoKWkmaS7bsDOZqOisqquequtxqCcq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
