The chain features pavé links and .33 inch white diamonds on each of the four orbs.

More than a decade after pursuing&nbsp;a career in music, he&nbsp;continues to chart well. The rapper&nbsp;has also had&nbsp;success in his non-musical business ventures. With a massive&nbsp;real-estate portfolio and the success of his OVO label, Drake has become one of hip-hops richest artists.</p><p>These days it looks like Drake isn’t afraid to spend his wealth either. In addition to dropping millions on luxury cars and a private jet —a Boeing 676 — the rapper also gambles millions betting on sporting events. Drizzy bet over $1 million on the Rams and Oddell Beckahm Jr in the Super Bowl and another $275,000 on UFC fighter Jorge Masvidal, <a href=#>though he did take a loss on the latter.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it’s difficult to write off the Young Papi as out of touch because he keeps generously handing our stacks&nbsp;of cash to a few&nbsp;lucky fans. While&nbsp;on vacation in Turks And Caicos, <a href=#>Drake teamed up with up-and-coming rapper Jack Harlow to bless a musician with 20 racks of cold hard cash</a>.</p><p>He did the same thing just weeks earlier <a href=#>when he handed&nbsp;a random fan $10,000.</a></p><p>For what it’s worth, Drake can afford to be generous. The rapper has built an impressive net worth and is reportedly worth north of $200 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Drake Celebrates The Success Of His New Album In Style By Renting Out An Arcade & Restaurant</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HNHH</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HighSnobriety</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8OrmKSdXZ%2FCtMCMnamoqKCasW65yKWjoqeeqHqwuoyaZJ%2BqkaO4brvCnpinZZikuqa%2BjJyfmqGeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
