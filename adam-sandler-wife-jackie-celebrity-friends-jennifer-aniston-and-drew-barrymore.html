Through their shared experiences on set, the three of them have developed a deep bond that transcends their professional lives.</p><p>Their friendship began when they met on the set of Just Go With It in 2010. Jackie was there to support her husband, while Aniston played the lead role opposite Adam. Despite having somewhat different personalities, Jackie and Aniston hit it off right away. According to CinemaBlend, they bonded over their love of filmmaking and their shared sense of humor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Justin Theroux And Jennifer Aniston On Good Terms Today, Years Post-Divorce?</a></span></p><p>Over the years, they have remained close despite busy schedules and demanding careers.

Their friendship has even extended to family vacations – Jackie and Adam have invited Jennifer to join them on trips to Hawaii.</p><h2 id=is-jackie-sandler-friends-with-drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Is Jackie Sandler Friends With Drew Barrymore?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/even-though-she-s-hosting-a-talk-show-drew-barrymore-says-this-one-actor-could-convince-her-to-do-another-film.jpg><p>The two first met on the set of the movie 50 First Dates in 2004, where they played best friends.

Since then, they have been spotted together at various events and have even worked together on several other movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their friendship is based on mutual respect, trust, and admiration for each other's talents. Jackie has often spoken about how much she admires Barrymore's work ethic and her ability to balance her career with her personal life. She has also praised Barrymore's kindness and generosity towards others.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Drew Barrymore Feel About Fans Calling Her A 'Cringey' Talk Show Host?</a></span></p><p>Their friendship has not been without its challenges though. In 2017, when Adam was snubbed by the Oscars for his performance in The Meyerowitz Stories, Drew took to social media to express her disappointment. However, this did not affect their friendship in any way as they continued to support each other through thick and thin.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam, Barrymore, and Aniston all are set to appear in an untitled film</a>, further cementing their closeness to each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-jackie-sandler-friends-with-david-spade><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Jackie Sandler Friends With David Spade?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-spade.png><p>This friendship is unique because they come from different backgrounds. Jackie Sandler is a former model and actress who has appeared in several movies mainly as cameos. David Spade, on the other hand, is a comedian and actor who rose to fame as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, similar to his best friend Adam Sandler, who the two clearly share in common.</p><p>Despite their different career paths, Jackie and Spade share a similar sense of humor. They both enjoy making people laugh and have collaborated on several projects together. According to IMDb, Jackie has appeared in several of David's movies such as Joe Dirt and Grown Ups 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After David Spade Made This Joke On 'Saturday Night Live', Eddie Murphy Was Furious With Him For Years</a></span></p><p>One reason why their friendship works so well is because they are both supportive of each other's careers. When Jackie was pregnant with her first child, David even offered to write her character out of his movie so she could take time off to be with her family.</p><p>Their friendship also shows that it's possible for men and women to be just friends without any romantic feelings involved. Despite being married to other people, their friendship remains platonic.</p><h2 id=is-jackie-sandler-friends-with-kevin-james><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Is Jackie Sandler Friends With Kevin James?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/doug.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Jackie and Kevin have worked together on numerous projects, including movies like Grown Ups and Pixels.
