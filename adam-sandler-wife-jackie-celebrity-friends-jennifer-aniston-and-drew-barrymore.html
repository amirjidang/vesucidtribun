In 2017, when Adam was snubbed by the Oscars for his performance in The Meyerowitz Stories, Drew took to social media to express her disappointment. However, this did not affect their friendship in any way as they continued to support each other through thick and thin.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam, Barrymore, and Aniston all are set to appear in an untitled film</a>, further cementing their closeness to each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-jackie-sandler-friends-with-david-spade><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Jackie Sandler Friends With David Spade?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-spade.png><p>This friendship is unique because they come from different backgrounds. Jackie Sandler is a former model and actress who has appeared in several movies mainly as cameos. David Spade, on the other hand, is a comedian and actor who rose to fame as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, similar to his best friend Adam Sandler, who the two clearly share in common.</p><p>Despite their different career paths, Jackie and Spade share a similar sense of humor. They both enjoy making people laugh and have collaborated on several projects together. According to IMDb, Jackie has appeared in several of David's movies such as Joe Dirt and Grown Ups 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After David Spade Made This Joke On 'Saturday Night Live', Eddie Murphy Was Furious With Him For Years</a></span></p><p>One reason why their friendship works so well is because they are both supportive of each other's careers. When Jackie was pregnant with her first child, David even offered to write her character out of his movie so she could take time off to be with her family.</p><p>Their friendship also shows that it's possible for men and women to be just friends without any romantic feelings involved. Despite being married to other people, their friendship remains platonic.</p><h2 id=is-jackie-sandler-friends-with-kevin-james><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Is Jackie Sandler Friends With Kevin James?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/doug.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Jackie and Kevin have worked together on numerous projects, including movies like Grown Ups and Pixels.
