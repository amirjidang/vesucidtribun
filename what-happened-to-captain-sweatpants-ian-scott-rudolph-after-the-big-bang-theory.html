Before landing his iconic role in this popular sitcom, Rudolph had minor roles in several movies and TV shows.</p><p>According to his IMDb profile, Rudolph’s first professional acting gig was a minor role as Office Jones in the 2008 movie Boiler Maker, which didn’t gain much traction. Despite this, this actor went on to appear in several popular TV shows. In 2010, Rudolph made a guest appearance in the sitcom The Middle. A year later, he appeared in one episode of the hit series Shameless and an episode of 1000 Ways to Die. In 2012, the actor played a homicidal waiter in a small sketch in Conan.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>One Of The Worst Guest Stars On The Big Bang Theory Also Played A Major Role On Young Sheldon</a></span></p><p>Despite only having played small roles in movies and TV series, this actor has amassed a significant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">net worth of $900,000</a>. Most of his current wealth probably came from The Big Bang Theory, given that his recurring role on this sitcom is his biggest and longest role up to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-ian-scott-rudolph-done-since-the-big-bang-theory-ended>What Has Ian Scott Rudolph Done Since The Big Bang Theory Ended?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ian-scott-rudolph-kevin-sussman-and-owen-thayer-2011.jpeg><p>Ian Scott Rudolph played Captain Sweatpants, a regular customer at Stuart Bloom’s comic book store, in The Big Bang Theory from 2009 to 2014. Ultimately, he appeared in 13 episodes, including "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary," "The Excelsior Acquisition," "The Wheaton Recurrence," "The 21-Second Excitation", "The Justice League Recombination" and "The Occupation Recalibration,” where his character spoke for the first time. This latter episode was also the last time he appeared on the show. Despite his short run on the show, he left a big impression on the fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The One Big Bang Theory Guest Star Johnny Galecki Went Out Of His Way And 'Cornered' To Get</a></span></p><p>Since his time in The Big Bang Theory came to an end, this actor has made small appearances in several movies and TV shows. In 2015, a year after he portrayed Captain Sweatpants for the last time, Rudolph appeared in one episode of the TV shows BFF: Best Friend Foundation and Jimmy & The Blitz, he also appeared in the short film Uh Oh, It’s Magic and in five episodes of the TV series Blank Pages.</p><p>In 2016, Rudolph appeared in an episode of the hit series Scorpion, as well as in an episode of MADtv. His last acting credit was in 2019 as a comedian in the TV series Sweet as Pye. It’s also worth noting that, in 2013, Rudolph and actor Andy Forrest, who plated Kyle in Parks and Rec, began a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">donation campaign online to get funds to make an indie film entirely in a boat</a>. However, it’s not clear whether that project ever saw the light.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-underpants-is-not-the-fans-rsquo-favorite-supporting-character-on-the-big-bang-theory>Captain Underpants Is Not The Fans’ Favorite Supporting Character On The Big Bang Theory</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sussman-Stuart.jpg><p>Although he made a big impression on the viewers with his portrayal of Captain Sweatpants, Ian Scott Rudolph is not the fans’ favorite secondary character in The Big Bang Theory. While there were many minor characters in the 12 seasons of the show, fans agree that Stuart Bloom, the owner of The Comic Center of Pasadena, is the best recurring character on the show, and Mayim Bialik agrees with them.</p><p>The Big Bang Theory star has admitted that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kevin Sussman was always her favorite guest star on the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sussman appeared in more than 80 episodes of TBBT, which is proof that he was a fan favorite all along. His popularity is due to his down-to-earth and chill personality. Funnily enough, Sussman has revealed that a lot of his work as <a href=# rel=nofollow>Stuart in The Big Bang Theory was him just acting like he normally does</a>. He even used to work in a comic book store like his character!</p><p>Likewise, <a href=# rel=nofollow>fans agree that the worst guest star of all time in The Big Bang Theory</a> was Jimmy Speckerman, who played Leonard’s high school bully. Despite his awful performance on the show, this actor went on to play George Cooper Sr., Sheldon’s father, in the spin-off series Young Sheldon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FAqauaoZ5iwLixwK2nmqakqHqqrc1mqpynpKl6s8HDqKOpoF2Ws7Wx0WaroZ1dl7aoecGapaBlpJ2ysL7YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
