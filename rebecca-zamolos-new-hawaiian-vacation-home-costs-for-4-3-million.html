She is also known for her presence on TikTok, with over 17.1 million followers Rebecca Zamolo already owns multiple other homes, including a slick mansion in L.A.’s Encino neighborhood and two weekend cabins up in scenic Big Bear Lake, but the high-earning YouTuber and veteran influencer, 40, is back on the real estate hunt. This time, she and husband Matt Slays are saying “Aloha!” to a particularly swanky part of Hawaii, having bought a vacation residence in sunny Wailea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>All Of Chris Martin's Girlfriends Ranked By Net Worth</b></a></span></p><p>Described in the listing as a “Maui villa” that’s both “modern and elegant,” the 2,600-square-foot home is located at the exclusive Ho’olei Residences, a gated resort community at the Grand Wailea hotel in Maui’s trendy Kihei neighborhood. Built in 2008 and recently updated, the turnkey villa was sold to Zamolo for $4.3 million, or nearly $200,000 more than the seller’s original asking price.</p><p>There’s a big outdoor motorcourt and garage parking, while indoor amenities include three ensuite bedrooms and an open-concept living area that marries the family, dining and living rooms together. Equipped with multicolored granite countertops and premium SubZero and Wolf appliances, the kitchen caters to both the indoor areas and outdoor lanais, the latter easily accessible through walls of disappearing Fleetwood doors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other highlights are not limited to a dedicated BBQ/outdoor kitchen area on one of the lanais, a master suite with its own private patio, stone floors throughout and a master bath with a built-in tub, dual sinks and rainfall shower.</p><p>Best of all, the listing notes that Ho’olei homeowners have easy access to all of the Wailea area’s famous resort amenities, including upscale restaurants, multiple golf courses, tennis courts, high-end shopping destinations and miles of white sand beaches. Residents will also enjoy the Grand Wailea’s grounds, plus a state-of-the-art fitness center and a communal swimming pool with peekaboo ocean views through the palm trees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born and raised in California’s Bay Area, Zamolo moved to Los Angeles as a young adult with the goal of becoming a professional actress. While health setbacks and other problems prevented her from fulfilling that dream, they happily led her to a second, highly lucrative career as a YouTube entertainer. Over the last ten years, she’s honed her craft across multiple channels and gained great fame among her target audience with her Game Master Network series. Today, Zamolo sports 13 million subscribers and north of five billion lifetime views on her main channel alone.</p><p>And whatever your opinion on Zamolo’s YouTube channel — which mainly consists of ultra-frenetic, fever dream-esque videos that cater to very young children — it’s made the former competitive gymnast enormously successful. According to various online resources, Zamolo’s various YouTube forays notch hundreds of millions of views per month, a number that could equate to earnings north of $5 million a year through Adsense revenue alone. And that number doesn’t include income from Zamolo’s vast array of lucrative sponsorship deals and merch products, which could easily add millions more to her annual bottom line, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i>.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>Bob Dylan’s ‘Desolation Row’ Handwritten Lyrics Are Being Sold for $425,000</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmarnZKasKStjLOYpqecpMBuusSwZKGZp5a2qq3NZq2am5GptrC6jKGmpp1dmLy0wNJmnaiqXWl6dHnMoqOloZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
