On top of that, even if a child star can stay out of trouble, it is a shame that the press follows kids around and they report <a href=#>when child stars mess up</a> even though everyone goes through growing pains. Unfortunately for former child star Angus T. Jones, there have been headlines about the times he did questionable things. For example, when it was reported that Jones was dating his “stalker” the were some pretty outrageous headlines about the situation. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, did Jones actually date his stalker?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-angus-t-jones-left-two-and-a-half-men>Why Angus T. Jones Left Two And A Half Men</h2><p>During the early-2010s, Angus T. Jones seemed to be in an enviable position since he was starring in one of the most popular shows on television, Two and a Half Men. However, based on what happened around that time, it seems pretty clear that Jones was struggling to figure out his place in the world at that time. Since he was a young man at that time, however, everyone should have been able to understand that Jones was going through a time of transition and give him a break. Instead, everything that Jones did in that period was harshly judged by most observers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notably, when Angus T. Jones found religion, he was filmed on camera calling out the show that made him rich and famous, Two and a Half Men. “If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching Two and a Half Men. I’m on Two and a Half Men and I don’t want to be on it. Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it’s just entertainment. Do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you you’ll have a decision to make when it comes to television, especially with what you watch.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Moment 'Two And A Half Men' Removed Angus T. Jones From The Show's Intro</a></span></p><p>After the video of Angus T. Jones’ comments about Two and a Half Men went public, it didn’t take long for his character to be mostly removed from the show. Shortly thereafter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones apologized for his remarks</a>. “I apologize if my remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity of which I have been blessed. I never intended that. Without qualification, I am grateful to and have the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and Half Men with whom I have worked and over the past 10 years who have become an extension of my family.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When looking at Angus T. Jones’ apology, it is interesting to note that he never walked back his remarks about Two and a Half Men’s quality as a show. Jones never said the show wasn’t filth or encouraged people to keep watching. With that in mind, it isn’t overly surprising that Jones never made a full-time return to Two and a Half Men’s cast.</p><h2 id=did-angus-t-jones-really-date-a-stalker>Did Angus T. Jones Really Date A Stalker?</h2><p>In the tabloids and on social media, it seems very clear that people care deeply about the private lives of the stars. For example, when a famous person goes through a breakup or starts dating someone new, there are loads of strangers that comment on the change in their relationship status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Famous On Again Off Again Relationships In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Unlike most of his peers, Angus T. Jones’ personal life has rarely been put under the spotlight which is remarkable since he has been famous since he was a kid. However, in 2012, that briefly changed when people linked Jones to a young woman who was only known as Sarah M. According to whosdatedwho.com Angus and Sarah are confirmed to have dated in the early-2010s. Assuming that is true, the only question that remains is whether or not Sarah was a stalker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, there are two reasons why Sarah M. has been called a stalker. First off, Sarah has a Flickr account where her pictures are uploaded under the name Stalker Sarah. Secondly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah has literally posted hundreds of photos of herself with celebrities</a>, if not thousands. As a result, it is easy to conclude that Sarah is obsessed with having her photos taken with stars as it would take a lot of effort to be around so many famous people.</p><p>According to reports, Angus T. Jones didn’t meet Sarah M. due to her potentially being a stalker. Instead, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the former couple got to know each other through the church that Jones joined</a> before he was recorded on camera bashing Two and a Half Men. With that in mind, it seems like a stretch to claim that Jones dated “his” stalker at the very least. As for whether or not Sarah deserves to be called a stalker, that seems somewhat unfair as well. Sure, it is incredible that Sarah has put so much effort into being around famous people. However, the word stalker implies that she is dangerous and there is no evidence that has ever been the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Nicolas Cage Says A Mime Stalked Him And Fans Aren't As Shocked As They Should Be</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlruowdJmq2ain6OytHnDmqueZZiewG6%2F05qjpJ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
