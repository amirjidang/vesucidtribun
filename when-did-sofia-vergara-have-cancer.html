The outspoken actress has a long list of achievements to her name, including passing her American citizenship test with flying colors, raising a son on her own, and building <a href=# rel=nofollow>a career worth many millions of dollars</a>.</p><p>Despite how well-known Sofia Vergara is, there is one thing she didn't necessarily want to share with fans years ago. When she was diagnosed with cancer, Sofia hid the news from the media, only sharing with her family and friends while she underwent treatment. Sofia had a specific reason for not wanting people to know what she was going through, though she's proud of herself for beating cancer today.</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara-keeps-some-parts-of-her-personal-life-quiet>Sofia Vergara Keeps Some Parts Of Her Personal Life Quiet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sofia-vergara.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seven years of marriage, most of them largely staying out of the public eye, Sofia Vergara announced she was divorcing her husband Joe Manganiello. Prior to that announcement, no one knew a whole lot about Sofia's personal life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sofia Vergara's Ex-Nick Loeb Lost Custody Of The Couple's Embryos And Blamed The Verdict On The Judge's Fandom For The Actress</a></span></p><p>Apart from her relationship status changing, Sofia largely focused on her acting work, speaking only occasionally about her family and relationships. She would share some details about her older brother's murder and her younger brother's struggles with substance abuse, and fans were able to see her loving relationship with her only child, Manolo.</p><p>But only years afterward did the story come out that Sofia Vergara had once been diagnosed with—and successfully fought—thyroid cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-sofia-vergara-have-cancer>When Did Sofia Vergara Have Cancer?</h2><p>Later explaining that she kept it quiet so as not to have to deal with the media while fighting for her life, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sofia Vergara shared her cancer diagnosis</a>. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2000 and began treatment almost immediately.</p><p>Looking back, Vergara explained, "I was fortunate to have caught it early and to have the support of my doctors and most importantly, my family." Sofia was 28 when she received her cancer diagnosis, though she didn't specifically say what type of thyroid cancer she had, only reiterating that she was lucky to have caught it early.</p><p>Elaborating on the experience, Sofia said, "I spent countless hours in radiation treatments, and, eventually, in surgery. Today, I get to call myself a cancer survivor." She also shared a photo of herself, her surgery scar visible, to commemorate her first acting class after diagnosis and treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Ariel Winter Really Felt About Working With Sofia Vergara On Modern Family</a></span></p><p>At that time, Sofia was a recognized actress, but she hadn't yet appeared in hits like Modern Family (the show started in 2009) or America's Got Talent. In fact, most of Sofia's more notable roles didn't come until after she finished treatment; she had no films prior to the diagnosis, only a handful of TV appearances on telenovelas, and a small spot on Baywatch in 1999.</p><p>Of the experience, Vergara summed up, "When you go through something like this, it's hard, but you learn a lot from it. Your priorities change. You don't sweat the small stuff."</p><h2 id=why-did-sofia-vergara-keep-her-cancer-diagnosis-a-secret>Why Did Sofia Vergara Keep Her Cancer Diagnosis A Secret?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230605_004956_0000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sofia's explanation for keeping her cancer diagnosis under wraps was simple: she didn't want the media attention while she was quite literally fighting for her life. Vergara told Health that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">she "didn't want publicity" for it</a>, because "you don't want to deal with anything else while you're going through it."</p><p>She also shared how she happened to find out she had cancer, thanks to a family history of diabetes. While having her son Manolo checked out by an endocrinologist, Sofia, too, got an exam, and the news wasn't great.</p><h3 id=the-survival-rate-for-thyroid-cancer-is-high>The Survival Rate For Thyroid Cancer Is High</h3><p>As scary as Sofia's brush with cancer was, the good news for her was that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">survival rate is around 99 percent for most types</a>; there are some types with an only 11 percent survival rate.</p><p>Regardless, Vergara doesn't take her health for granted and celebrates cancer awareness by advising her followers to get checked out regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After regaining her health, it seems Vergara never let up; <a href=# rel=nofollow>she maintains a rigorous diet and workout routine</a> that's about more than just looks.</p><h3 id=sofia-vergara-is-healthy-today-but-her-divorce-might-be-tough>Sofia Vergara Is Healthy Today, But Her Divorce Might Be Tough</h3><p>Sofia Vergara has dated plenty of famous Hollywood men, but it seems she was flying solo when she received her cancer diagnosis before turning 30. She was married to ex-husband Joe Gonzalez from 1991 to 1993 and didn't marry Joe Manganiello until 2015.</p><p>Sofia's rumored romance with Enrique Iglesias was said to have ended the same year she was diagnosed, while the actress was also linked to famous criminal Chris Paciello for a time (it's unclear whether they actually dated).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Sofia Vergara's Lavish Lifestyle Lead To Her Divorce from Joe Manganiello?</a></span></p><p>By 2014, when Sofia and Joe went public with their relationship, fans were thrilled for the actress. Joe gushed about Sofia in various interviews, leading fans to <a href=# rel=nofollow>wonder what went wrong in the marriage</a> for them to split in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, Sofia Vergara is one tough human being, so there's no doubt that in the aftermath of the divorce, she'll be just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2eYrGqsIyspp%2BhkWLDpr7GmqmaZZiWw6Z5wpqlnJ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
