While it's challenging to become a part of the show, many of SNL's cast members go on to snag some huge roles. This also true for the current crop of SNL stars,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who've found work outside of the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, some stars aren't so lucky. A few of them have gone on to bigger and better things, but have since found themselves labeled as"uncastable" for various reasons. This is true of&nbsp;the longest-running SNL stars and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cast members who only lasted one season</a>. You may be surprised to find out why a few of these hilarious stars are getting less work than before.</p><p>Without further ado, here's why these SNL stars are not getting cast.</p><h2 id=chevy-chase-continues-to-have-a-negative-reputation-in-hollywood><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Chevy Chase Continues To Have A Negative Reputation In Hollywood</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chevy Chase is notoriously difficult to work with</a>; during his&nbsp;SNL days, he quarreled with Bill Murray. Many writers and directors have tried to give him another chance due to his undeniable brilliance, but it's rarely worked out.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Community creator, Dan Harmon, constantly fought with him on set, causing Chase to eventually get fired. Additionally, Will Ferrell called him "the worst guest-SNL host" he's ever worked with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=victoria-jackson-irked-her-snl-co-stars><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Victoria Jackson Irked Her SNL Co-Stars</span></h2><p>Victoria Jackson knows exactly why nobody wants to work with her anymore, and it all goes back to her days on Saturday Night Live, which lasted from 1986 to 1992. According to Nicki Swift, Jackson would constantly try to convert her castmates to Christianity and they REALLY didn't appreciate it. She's since gained the reputation for being a tad unhinged.</p><h2 id=no-one-knew-what-to-do-with-norm-macdonald><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>No One Knew What To Do With Norm MacDonald</span></h2><p>Norm MacDonald is brilliant, in a dry and slightly odd kind of way. While he's excelled as a stand-up comedian, and as a writer on shows like Roseanne, no one really knew what to do with him on-screen.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SNL wasn't sure of Norm MacDonald</a> when he was on the show, which is one of the reasons why they fired him. According to Nicki Swift, he also got into a fistfight or two on the set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-kattan-suffered-from-a-life-changing-injury-and-a-negative-reputation><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Chris Kattan Suffered From A Life-Changing Injury...And A Negative Reputation</span></h2><p>The reason why you haven't seen Chris Kattan in anything since SNL and Night At The Roxbury, aside from a stint on Dancing With The Stars, is two-pronged. First and foremost, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he suffered a life-changing neck injury after a failed stunt</a>, which definitely impacted his career. However, he's also been known for being somewhat unpleasant. SNL alumnus, Tracy Morgan, wrote a book. In the book, he slammed Kattan for being mean and difficult.</p><h2 id=mike-myers-was-hard-to-work-with-so-he-built-a-successful-career-on-his-own-terms><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mike Myers Was Hard To Work With, So He Built&nbsp;A Successful Career On His Own Terms</span></h2><p>So many of us adore Mike Myers, particularly because of Wayne's World and the Austin Powers movies. While he's recently appeared in a film or two, namely Bohemian Rhapsody and Inglorious Basterds, his career basically stopped due to him gaining the reputation of being difficult to work with. Myers has done his best to rehabilitate his image, mostly by creating his own work.</p><h2 id=gilbert-gottfried-bombed-but-still-has-a-dedicated-cult-following><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gilbert Gottfried Bombed But Still Has A Dedicated Cult Following</span></h2><p>If you like your humor unhinged and uncomfortably inappropriate, Gilbert Gottfried is your man. This is why he's maintained a strong, cult-like following. His fans flock to his stand-up shows. Fans also love his retro film and TV podcast, Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Gottfried rarely gets hired, aside from the odd celebrity roast. or voice work in Aladdin and Family Guy. According to Business Insider, despite being friendly and easy to work with, he bombed during his time on SNL and he's truly a bit strange in real life.</p><h2 id=randy-quaid-flew-off-the-deep-end><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Randy Quaid Flew Off The Deep End</span></h2><p>Yep, before Independence Day, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and flying completely off the deep end, Randy Quaid was on SNL. He only did one season - 1985-86. In recent years, he's known for his outlandish conspiracy theories and being on the run from the law. So, yeah, that pretty much explains why you no longer see him in anything.</p><h2 id=al-franken-got-himself-intro-some-very-public-trouble><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Al Franken Got Himself Intro Some Very Public Trouble</span></h2><p>After writing on SNL for many years, and then staring on the show from 1977 until 1980, Al Franken became a successful senator. However, he became embroiled in a public scandal and was forced to resign. It's unlikely that he'll ever have a career in Hollywood again, but he could stage a political comeback, given his passionate supporters and strong track record of doing good work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audiences-didn-t-exactly-fall-in-love-with-peter-aykroyd><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Audiences Didn't Exactly Fall In Love With Peter Aykroyd</span></h2><p>Dan Aykroyd is easily one of the most famous and accomplished SNL alumni around, but audiences didn't exactly warm to his younger brother, Peter. While he co-wrote and co-starred with his brother in the film,&nbsp;Nothing But Trouble, he's basically been absent from the industry since his days on SNL.</p><h2 id=ann-risley-also-didn-t-win-the-hearts-of-audience-members><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ann Risley Also Didn't Win The Hearts Of Audience Members</span></h2><p>Just like Peter Aykroyd, Ann Risley didn't seem to get a lot of audience praise. According to Business Insider, she only appeared on SNL in a few episodes before she was let go. She actually hasn't even appeared on-screen since the 1993 TV movie,&nbsp;Jericho Fever. However, she did run an acting school in Arizona for a number of years, called The Studio For Actors.</p><h2 id=charles-rocket-never-recovered-from-unfair-blame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Charles Rocket Never Recovered From Unfair Blame</span></h2><p>In 1980, Lorne Michaels briefly left his duties as the showrunner and producer of Saturday Night Live. The 1980 season was known as one of the worst ever, and Charles Rocket was unfairly blamed for some of it. Part of the reason why was because his Weekend Update segments became hammier than usual, due to lack of leadership.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was eventually fired for swearing on air and his career never recovered. Unfortunately, he passed tragically in 2005.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SNL: Who Were The Youngest Celebs To Ever Get A Gig?</a></span></p><h2 id=nora-dunn-didn-t-get-along-with-her-co-stars-or-producers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nora Dunn Didn't Get Along With Her Co-Stars Or Producers</span></h2><p>If you don't get along with your co-stars, you absolutely have to get along with the producers. That's a lesson Nora Dunn learned the hard way when NBC decided not to renew her contract. However, according to Insider, Dunn knew this was going to happen, as she publicly boycotted an SNL episode hosted by Andrew Dice Clay. This was the last straw for both the cast and her bosses.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking The Original SNL Cast And Hosts From Worst To Best</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-piscopo-s-blow-up-with-eddie-murphy-resulted-in-permanent-career-damage><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Joe Piscopo's Blow-Up With Eddie Murphy Resulted In Permanent Career Damage</span></h2><p>If you have a public feud with one of the biggest and most beloved stars in the world, there's going to be fallout. That's precisely what happened to Joe Piscopo, according to Insider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the mid-80s, Eddie Murphy was hired at&nbsp;SNL and completely saved the show from ruin. However, Murphy didn't get along with his fellow cast member, Joe Piscopo, who was slowly building a terrible reputation. Because of this, Piscopo left SNL and didn't have the career he dreamed of.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The SNL Hosts Who Caused The Most Controversy (So Far)</a></span></p><h2 id=jay-mohr-stole-a-sketch-and-that-didn-t-exactly-go-over-well><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jay Mohr Stole A Sketch And That Didn't Exactly Go Over Well</span></h2><p>According to Salon, Jay Mohr pretty much wrecked his entire career when he wrote an SNL sketch featuring stolen material from fellow comedian, Rick Shapiro. Mohr purposefully wrote and performed the sketch live on SNL...and got everybody in trouble. More importantly, he tarnished his own reputation which never really recovered, despite the occasional acting gig.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 SNL Rumors We Hope Are True (And 8 We Hope Aren’t)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmv8RmqqekXajBor7SZpirnV2jvLV5xp6rraGenHqkrdKtZJqmqaK8s7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
