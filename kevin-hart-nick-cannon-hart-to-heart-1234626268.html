It’s like Spades, I got eight and a possible nine,” Canon responds when Hart asks how many children his Real Husbands Of Hollywood&nbsp;costar has. They both laugh and Cannon continues, “I like children, damn it!”</p><p>He added, “It gives me the ability to say, ‘Man I can affect so much,’ ” he tells Hart.</p><p>Cannon is the father of seven children total. His eldest children are 10-year-old fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, with ex-wife Mariah Carey. The “Gigalo” rapper shares a four-year-old son Golden and a nine-month-old daughter Powerful Queen with Brittany Bell. He also has twins Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa born on June 14. His youngest child, with Alyssa Scott, is baby Zen Scott Cannon born on June 23.</p><p>During a recent appearance on <a href=#>The Breakfast Club,</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Wild N Out&nbsp;creator explained his perspective on monogamy and marriage as “a Euro-centric concept.”</p><p>Beyond parenting, Hart and Cannon also discussed comedy from a professional standpoint, sharing how they viewed each other and their earned opportunities in Hollywood. The co-stars also chatted about Cannon landing the lead role in the 2002 film Drumline and opened up on&nbsp;how their relationship as peers and friends has evolved.</p><p>“There was a high amount of envy early on in our careers” revealed Hart. “I remember you were clicking so fast. You were putting the beats together so quick.”</p><p>The Ride Along star continued, “Every young black actor in Hollywood at the time, this was the role of a lifetime for so many. I remember when you got the part, there was no animosity. There was no ill-will, like, ‘Damn. I can’t believe I didn’t get it. Damn, it went to Nick Cannon.’ It was like ‘That’s a good dude. That’s a good dude. He deserved it. And you not only rocked that opportunity, but as others came…we developed a great energy and it’s always been that yin and yang.”</p><p>“It’s interesting too when you talk about that, clearly, I’m not a competitive person by any means, but I also understand what you’re talking about,” Cannon responded.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Hart To Heart</a>&nbsp;drops new episodes in batches on Thursdays on the streaming platform Peacock.
