After all, most people will never know what it feels like to be followed around by a slew of paparazzi wanting to capture them on camera at their most vulnerable. On top of that, if people take a closer look at Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s lives, the twins are proof positive of a dark truth about Hollywood.</p><h2 id=the-olsen-twins-had-child-star-problems>The Olsen Twins Had Child Star Problems</h2><p>In the entertainment business, there are loads of people working hard in an attempt to craft movies and TV shows that audiences can relate to. Since many adults have kids, that inherently means that lots of TV shows and movies will similarly feature child actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, there are quite a few examples of former child stars who went on to become highly successful adult actors. On top of that, many adults who were famous actors as kids have gone on to get out of the business and enjoy leading a normal life away from the spotlight. On the other hand, some former child stars have gone on to become cautionary tales.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Disgraced Child Stars Who Ended Up In Prison</a></span></p><p>Of course, the idea that a lot of former child stars struggle in life is widely agreed upon at this point so it certainly isn’t a concept that could be revealed by the Olsen twins. However, when you learn more about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s experiences during their years as child stars, their story reveals that Hollywood is a darker place for young stars than people knew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-revealed-a-dark-truth-about-hollywood>How Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Revealed A Dark Truth About Hollywood</h2><p>In 2015, the documentary Unauthorized Full House Story was released which led to the show’s fans learning that John Stamos tried to get Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen fired from the show. As Stamos explained when he was interviewed for the documentary, the reason <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wanted the Olsen Twins fired</a> is they cried too much.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does John Stamos Keep In Touch With The Olsen Twins?</a></span></p><p>“It’s sort of true that the Olsen twins cried a lot. It was very difficult to get the shot. So I [gesturing], ‘Get them out…!’ That is actually 100 percent accurate. They brought in a couple of unattractive redheaded kids. We tried that for a while and that didn’t work. [Producers] were like, all right, get the Olsen twins back. And that’s the story.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Full House fans learned that John Stamos tried to get Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen fired, many of them were outraged. After all, they adored the Olsen Twins’ portrayal of Michelle Tanner and he almost took that away from them. However, while feeling that way is somewhat understandable, it seems clear that a lot of people arguably took the wrong thing from that story.</p><p>In 1991, the Washington Post published an article about Full House. In that article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a disturbing picture of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s experiences making Full House</a> became clear. “The Olsens, Later said, ‘were very calm babies. They were smiley babies. They weren't real hyper and they weren't lethargic either. When we did the series the first year, Ashley was very much afraid to come on the set and her sister, Mary Kate, did most of the scenes.’ Both twins had trouble adjusting to the return to the studio after the lengthy writers' strike of 1988. Lights and sound booms that they had ignored as babies assumed monstrous proportions.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what John Stamos and that Washington Post article revealed about the Olsen Twins' time filming Full House as babies, it boggles the mind that they continued starring in the show. After all, it seems clear that on several occasions Mary-Kate and Ashley were deeply afraid of the filming process. Despite that, since the “show must go on” mentality runs rampant in Hollywood, adults continued to routinely frighten the Olsens when they were babies. Worse yet, some of those adults were annoyed that scared babies, who simply wanted to be comforted and made to feel safe, cried a lot.</p><p>In 2010, Mary-Kate Olsen was interviewed by Marie Claire and revealed how she and her sister feel about their time as child stars. According to Mary-Kate, she and Ashley felt like “little monkey performers” when they were child stars. On top of that, Mary-Kate revealed that when she sees photos of her childhood, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has a troubling reaction</a>. "I look at old photos of me, and I don't feel connected to them at all… I would never wish my upbringing on anyone…"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though <a href=#>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are fortunate to be wealthy</a>, based on what has been learned about their experiences in Hollywood, it seems clear they would give that up. In fact, when the Olsen Twin’s sister Elizabeth began to pursue an acting career, Mary-Kate and Ashley almost made her give it up. Based on what has been learned about the Olsen twins’ on-set experiences as kids, that makes sense.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen Explains How Sisters Mary-Kate And Ashley Almost Made Her Give Up Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYriiwMRmmKecXZbAqbjEsmSopKOau26%2FwKKbZpmSpMK1eceoo6Wxp6S8pXnCmqmenaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
