However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McMahon</a> is a sucker for a return and in truth, comebacks do boost the ratings. However, it is hard to steer clear from the elephant in the room at times, the fact that wrestlers age just like the rest of us. On this list, we’ll take a look at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE legends </a>that took a hit up top.</p><p>On the flip side, we’ll also discuss the wrestlers that continue to age like a fine wine and in truth, look almost identical to their earlier days in the business. Here are WWE legends that are hiding their real hair while others are flaunting it. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id=hiding-shawn-michaels><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Hiding – Shawn Michaels</span></h2><p>We really hate to do this to such a legend and arguably the greatest in-ring performer ever but clearly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn</a> hasn’t been showing off his new head of hair very much since cutting the long locks off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays when he’s on WWE programming, Shawn’s typically rocking a trucker style of hat – who knows, maybe he’s trying to grow it back?</p><h2 id=flaunting-edge><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Flaunting – Edge</span></h2><p>Some might argue that Edge looks better now at the age of 46 than he did a decade ago in his 30s.</p><p>Edge returned to the ring at the Rumble, looking better than ever before, sporting a lean six-pack. Not only that, but his head of hair is also still in the same shape as it was before, aside from a couple of gray hairs that are inevitable.</p><h2 id=hiding---john-cena><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Hiding - John Cena</span></h2><p>When his career finally comes to a close, Cena will be a member of WWE’s Mount Rushmore for his impact on the industry.</p><p>Since leaving WWE, John has experimented with a few other looks, in comparison to his shaved look with WWE. Fans caught a bald spot on Cena’s head while he was rocking the new look… maybe that’s why he kept it so short for all those years?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hiding---hulk-hogan><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Hiding - Hulk Hogan</span></h2><p>Some might say this has held true for the Hulkster since the ‘90s. Hogan is always rocking a bandana wherever he goes. We got a few glimpses of the Hulkster without it, once which took place in court.</p><p>Clearly, Hulk has seen better days, however physically, he still looks pretty darn jacked and in good shape. Just keep the bandana on brother.</p><h2 id=flaunting-booker-t><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Flaunting – Booker T</span></h2><p>Booker is another guy that seems to be aging in reverse, he would event take to the ring most recently, wrestling for his Reality Of Wrestling promotion.</p><p>Booker is still in phenomenal shape while that signature head of hair remains in place as if we’re watching an episode of RAW in the early 2000s. We can dig that, booker.</p><h2 id=hiding---triple-h><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hiding - Triple H</span></h2><p>To his credit, Triple H isn’t afraid to rock the bald look and in fact, he transitioned into it pretty darn well.</p><p>However, what he was hiding from WWE fans was a short hair look while rocking an extra-long beard. This all took shape during his time in quarantine.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Triple H showed off the look on WWE Backstage </a>and clearly, he wasn’t digging it as on the SmackDown anniversary celebration, he showed up looking like his old self, without the hair or extra-long beard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=flaunting---jbl><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Flaunting - JBL</span></h2><p>Let’s give it to JBL, the guy looks pretty good in his 50s, whether you like him, or you don’t.</p><p>He appeared at WrestleMania 36 on commentary along with an appearance on WWE Backstage. To JBL’s credit, he always looks clean cut in the roles and quite professional. Plus, that hair is always on point.</p><h2 id=hiding---jake-roberts><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hiding - Jake Roberts</span></h2><p>AEW has done a great job in utilizing legends to their fullest. Jake Roberts was put in a position as the manager of Lance Archer. He cut a terrific promo on route to Archer’s debut.</p><p>His spot on AEW also showed that Roberts did a bit of a hair color dye, though certain great spots were still&nbsp;noticeable.</p><h2 id=flaunting---torrie-wilson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Flaunting - Torrie Wilson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In truth, we could have included almost every alum Diva from the 2000s, they’ve all aged like a fine wine.</p><p>Torrie, in particular, seems to be aging in reverse, especially due to her fitness practice on the norm. These days, Wilson is happily married and still posting jaw-dropping photos via IG.</p><h2 id=hiding---shane-mcmahon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hiding - Shane McMahon</span></h2><p>We got grey hair just be watching Shane over the last couple of decades. Even in his late 40s, Shane was putting his body on the line for the fans.</p><p>Of course, like everyone else, Shane has gotten a little greyer while his hairline was especially noticeable during his feud with The Miz.</p><h2 id=flaunting---chris-jericho><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Flaunting - Chris Jericho</span></h2><p>He’ll turn 50 near the end of 2020 in November. Despite the older age, Y2J continues to move forward like a fine wine, as the face of AEW.</p><p>Making the decision to leave WWE was without a doubt the correct one, as we’re seeing some of his best character work yet. If Y2J wants, he can easily wrestle into his 60s at this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Chris Jericho Left WWE And The Chances Of A Return</a></p><p>Sources - IG & YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnq4w8Rmo56flaOxtHnAq5xmoJmZtq%2BzjK2fnqGiYr%2Bmrctmn5qhomLEqbXLnmSorJiav7R5wKucZp6clsKvwMinnmahpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
