If handled correctly, a TV show can survive such drastic changes; perhaps even thrive. This was definitely not the case with ABC's crime-drama, Castle in 2016, when they announced that Stana Katic would not be returning for Season 9.This would have likely been a bittersweet pill to swallow for her co-star, Nathan Fillion. The pair were reported to have been feuding, but Katic's leaving eventually meant that his own stint on the series was cut short. Not only that but the pair were reported to have had a personal relationship that went beyond the TV show. So how did Nathan really feel about Stana's leaving Castle?<strong>Updated October 18th, 2022: </strong>Speculation continues to swirl about Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic's relationship post-Castle, and how both parties feel about the show today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-stana-katic-leave-castle>Why Did Stana Katic Leave Castle?</h2><p>Castle was the brainchild of screenwriter Andrew Marlowe, who famously penned the 1997 smash hit political drama Air Force One starring Harrison Ford.</p><p>Fillion played the titular character Rick Castle, a mystery novelist who partners with a homicide detective to solve crimes, starting with a copycat murder based on his book series.</p><p>Katic portrayed Detective Beckett and earned plenty of accolades for the role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Nathan Fillion And Stana Katic?</a></span></p><p>In April 2016, as the series was coming towards the end of what had been a rough Season 8 ratings-wise, it was announced that Katic would be leaving the show. Unfortunately, it seemed that Katic had not made the decision independently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress wasn't the only departure at that point; also set to exit was fellow main cast member Tamala Jones. Jones had been playing a medical examiner by the name Dr. Lanie Parish, a close friend of Beckett and often a love interest for Javi Esposito, a member of Beckett's homicide team.</p><p>After the reported drama, though, it seemed that Stana's leaving had some deeper meaning behind it.</p><h2 id=there-were-rumors-of-tension-between-the-two-actors>There Were Rumors Of Tension Between The Two Actors</h2><p>On the surface level, the news of Katic's impending exit might have been construed as being very good for Fillion.</p><p>After all, rumors of tension between the two co-stars had already become very rife. This in itself was already threatening to break the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Say Nathan Fillion's Bad Acting Ruined 'Castle'">Fans Say Nathan Fillion's Bad Acting Ruined 'Castle'</a></span></p><p>Viewers had begun to see just <a href=#>how bad things had gotten on set</a>. Inside sources hinted that Katic and Fillion 'despised each other.'</p><p>The friction between them was apparently very evident, with the actor often being so 'nasty' towards his colleague that she would retreat to her dressing room to cry. It was even said that at some point, <a href=#>they sought couple's therapy to try and work through their issues</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nathan Fillion Might Be Single, But His Love Life Is Not Boring</a></span></p><p>It is unlikely that the rumors were completely unfounded, but at the same time, they were also never totally confirmed. More telling might be the public tribute that Fillion paid to Katic once it became official that her tenure on Castle was up.</p><p>The Canadian-born star took to his Twitter account to praise Katic for the work they had done together. "Stana has been my partner, and I thank her for creating the character of Beckett who will live on for all of us," he wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-felt-nathan-fillion-s-pain>Fans Felt Nathan Fillion's Pain</h2><p>Fillion even went on to send his best wishes for any of her future endeavors, saying, "I wish her well and have no doubt she will succeed in everything she pursues. She will be missed."</p><p>In the comments, fans generally appeared to take his sentiments at face value. Most offered their support, while others simply expressed their dismay at the choice that ABC had made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few weeks after the actress was shown the door, ABC announced that Castle had in fact reached the end of its own road. That was in May 2016.</p><p>Years later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katic still couldn't put a finger on the network's motivation</a> to send her packing. "I'm actually still not clear on the thought process behind the way that it went down,' she told Entertainment Weekly in 2018. "It hurt and it was a harsh ending."</p><p>At the end of the day, only Fillion knows the deep-down truth of his mindset towards all this drama. His public reaction does suggest, though, that he was genuinely sorry to see Katic go, <a href=#>even if the two never formally made up</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilmqyYlrtussilo6KnnmLAta3NmmSkmaSesG6x16KrZpuRqMGtsYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmnpmnsqV5wJuaaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
