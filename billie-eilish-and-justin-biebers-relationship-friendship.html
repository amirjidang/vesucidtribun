So obsessed that her mother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted to put her in therapy to deal with it</a>. This is because Billie claimed that she was in "so much pain" due to her girlhood obsession with the musical artist who was at the height of his fame at the time. Billie would sob over his songs. She had posters of him plastered to the walls of her childhood bedroom, where she often still sleeps despite becoming equally as rich and famous as the young man she once pinned over. In short, there was no stopping her crush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Billie Eilish Really Spends Her Incredible Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Of course, now Billie and Justin know each other. They first met in a documented moment included in her AppleTV+ documentary. Of course, Billie was in tears and could barely hold herself together. In fact, she walked away from Justin initially. But Justin, who has always been good with his fans (despite how talented and famous they may be) followed. Eventually, they spoke and the rest is history. But what really is that history? And what exactly is Billie and Justin's relationship today?</p><h2 id=justin-and-hailey-bieber-made-billie-eilish-feel-comfortable-at-industry-events>Justin And Hailey Bieber Made Billie Eilish Feel Comfortable At Industry Events</h2><p>While discussing the value and curse of fame, as well as the pros and cons of being friends with other famous people, during an interview on The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show in 2021, Billie shed some new light on her relationship with Justin. While there's been a lot of press about her adoration for him, until her interview with the radio legend, little was known about what really happens between her and Justin behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Is [Justin Bieber] still a big deal to you or has that worn off?" Howard asked Billie during their outstanding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">December 2021 interview</a>.</p><p>"It has not worn off. I cherish that moment to this day and I think I always will. You know, I'm friends with him now and I talk a lot to him on the phone," Billie admitted. "We talk through stuff. He's really such a sweet guy. And I call [his wife] Hailey and Hailey's kind of become the person that I look for when I go to events where there are famous people. I get so flipped out to go to stuff like that. Even though it is fun. But kind of... the dinners scare the s*** out of me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Gets Slapped With Parking Ticket While Attending Church Service</a></span></p><p>Billie went on to explain that these events don't allow an artist's team. And her team (those who work for and with her) are who she's friends with in real life. So, when Billie goes to these events, she feels extremely alone.</p><p>"Hailey's become who I look for [at these events]."</p><p>"She's your rock?" Howard asked.</p><p>"Yeah, she's great," Billie said.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-looks-out-for-billie-eilish>Justin Bieber Looks Out For Billie Eilish</h2><p>In 2020, Justin Bieber, shortly after his "Bad Guy" collaboration with Billie, claimed that he wanted to protect her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I definitely feel protective of her. It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn," he said during an emotional interview with Zane Lowe and Apple Music. "Everyone telling me they love me, and, you know, just turn their back on you in a second."</p><p>"If she ever needs me, I’m gonna be here for her. I don’t want her to go through anything I went through. I don’t wish that upon anybody. If she ever needs me, I’m just a call away."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Of Justin Bieber's Massive Net Worth Is Spent On Real Estate</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Justin's offer wasn't an empty promise as Billie seemed to confirm to Howard Stern that she uses him for support. Prior to the two of them meeting, Billie was always extremely generous and defended Justin even when he did numerous things that caused controversy. She knew that he had been through a lot and the world was putting an unfair amount of pressure and focus on him, not unlike other young stars.</p><p>"He's amazing. He's so sweet and, like, I feel, just, honestly, I feel for him, man. He's been through a lot, dude," she once told Ellen DeGeneres.</p><p>While a teenage Billie Eilish would have surely loved to be caught in a romance with Justin, that phase in her life seems to have passed. She's even good friends with Justin's wife. But Billie's admiration for the "Baby" singer has never diminished. After all, he has had her back when she really needed it. Both through his music and in person. Clearly, the two have a connection that few other artists have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Justin Bieber, Katy Perry And More Celebs Who Have Reportedly Considered Space Travel</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXZa7pXnJrqqtoZ5ir6qxwZ6prGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6p77InqWdq5ievXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
