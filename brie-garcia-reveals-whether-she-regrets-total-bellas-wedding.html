The <a href=#>nuptials were aired</a> on an episode of Brie’s reality show, on which she starred with twin sister<a href=#><strong> Nikki Garcia</strong></a>.</p><p>“I think I would change that for him because marriage is more about what each other wants. And right there, I showed I didn’t compromise,” Brie confessed. “And that’s what I’ve learned in marriage. Compromise has been my big thing in my marriage. Communication [and] compromise.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Brie-Garcia-Admits-She-Would-Change-Her-TV-Wedding-to-Husband-Bryan-Danielson-I-Didn-t-Compromise-468.jpg><p>Nikki, 39, also <a href=#>televised her nuptials</a> to husband <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a> — and teased that her sister could potentially <a href=#>get her vows renewed</a> “amongst the trees” as a way of marking her milestone anniversary. Brie agreed and reiterated that there would be “no cameras” present for the intimate moment.</p><p>Two years after they walked down the aisle, Brie and Danielson announced they were <a href=#>expecting their first child</a>. Their daughter, Birdie, was born in May 2017. Three years later, the pair expanded their family with son Buddy in August 2020.

Now, we were attached to them outside of the ring because we were using the name so much, but at the end of the day, it was a big part of WWE.”</p><p>She added: “It’s not only been freeing and it feels like we really have just gained power, but it’s almost like we can do whatever we want without asking permission. It’s like we can just grow and nobody’s going to hold us back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmaeqit0ZygmmWimsOmrcusZLCglam1pr6MrJ%2BeZaKatLOx06xkraeklrlursSlo5qrXayypbDIp55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
