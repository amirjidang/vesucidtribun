They had a private ceremony at the 6th Arrondissement City Hall in Paris. They also did a bigger wedding two months later in Venice. This time, it was attended by many stars like <a href=#>Parallel Mothers star Penelope Cruz</a>, Antonio Banderas, and Charlize Theron. Two weddings for Pinault's two failed marriage proposals to <a href=#>the Eternals actress</a>...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Salma Hayek’s Father Actually Ruined Her First Career</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-salma-hayek-reject-her-husband-39-s-proposal-twice>Why Did Salma Hayek Reject Her Husband's Proposal Twice?</h2><p>In 2015, Hayek revealed to Entertainment Times that her husband proposed to her three times before she said yes. "You must overcome fear to feel free and discover your strengths," she said of her past marriage phobia. "I used to have a phobia of snakes and you can see me dancing with my biggest fear in From Dusk Till Dawn. I was also afraid of the dark. And of marriage. And here I am, married." Still, she admitted to being embarrassed about having Pinault propose to her multiple times. "That was the biggest fear I've ever overcome," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, the Frida star told Associated Press that at first, she didn't think Pinault was right for her. "At the beginning, I didn't think [he was right for me], but he won me over really fast," she shared. "I was stereotyping him as a rich man. I thought, 'This is not my type of guy at all.'" The actress also said that they hit it off during a "silly" first conversation. "It was so silly. We started talking about football. We're both crazy about soccer," she said. "And then we started talking about science. We love space and physics, and he was so smart and charming and funny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She noted: "Nobody had talked to me about those things the first time I met [them]. It's not normally the typical conversation. I realized, this person that [seems so different to me] is my perfect match." Clearly, Hayek doesn't regret taking that leap of faith. "I'm married to the love of my life. He is an amazing man, self-confident and feminist, who likes strong women and also knows how to take care of them," Hayek gushed. "There are a lot of strong women with power and determination that when we got home we like to have someone to look after us and take over the reins."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tiffany Hadish Has Her Own Room At Salma Hayek's London Home</a></span></p><h2 id=how-many-kids-do-salma-hayek-amp-her-husband-have>How Many Kids Do Salma Hayek & Her Husband Have?</h2><p>In 2007, after a year of dating, Hayek and Pinault announced that they were engaged and that they were expecting a child. They welcomed <a href=#>their only daughter Valentina Paloma</a>, 14, in September of that year. Hayek was 40 years old. They were the ideal happy family until in 2008, <a href=#>supermodel Linda Evangelista</a> revealed that the chairman of Kerring Foundation was the father of her three-year-old son, Augustin James Evangelista, 15. It led Hayek and Pinault to call off their engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But as the CEO took care of Evangelista's legal demand for child support, it was made clear that he fathered the child back when he wasn't dating Hayek yet. Pinault also has two other children from his previous marriage to Dorothée Lepère: Mathilde, 21, and François, 24. Hayek is close to all of them, too. "I always wanted to have a lot of children, and I was not able to. My body, as a miracle, had one," the actress said of getting pregnant in her 40s. "The huge blessing I've had is that my husband has three other children. So I have four. And they are all so different."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Salma Hayek Finds Her Daughter Valentina So Inspiring</a></span></p><h2 id=salma-hayek-thought-her-husband-was-cheating-with-english-instructor>Salma Hayek Thought Her Husband Was Cheating With English Instructor</h2><p>During an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in 2017, Hayek said that her daughter would tease her and her husband over their poor English. "We speak in English with very bad accents, I don't know how my daughter doesn't have a bad accent cause in the house it's a disaster," the actress shared. "So, about a year ago he [Pinault] said, 'you know what guys, I’m going to get a dialect coach and I'm going to get rid of the accent before you who has been living in the States for like 67 years' referring to me.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Hayek thought that her husband didn't pursue the lessons because he never mentioned it again. "A couple of days ago I'm texting someone and I see his phone, and there's this message," she said, reciting the text in a seductive other woman's voice: "Hi, this is Elena, if you want to improve your English, you have to practice, do you want to practice now?" The Bandidas star said that she was so shocked that she quickly confronted Pinault about it. "I'm Mexican, you know it doesn't go well," Hayek recalled of that moment.</p><p>"So I was so furious and I said well obviously she's desperate, he's not calling her you know, should I say something? I trust him, I won't say anything," she continued. "Four hours later, we're eating, I'm cool, I go 'hi baby, everything is okay and then I go, who the hell is Elena!'" Pinault denied knowing any Elena to which Hayek responded: "You tell that Elena that I speak English and you can practice your English with me because she sent you a message." The French mogul later realized that Hayek had seen a text from a language app called ELSA. "His French accent is still very strong, so ELSA doesn't work," the actress quipped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Angelina Jolie And Salma Hayek's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqK6tucBmn5qxlaB6s7HJnpqtnZRitaa%2BjKGsrJqRo7G0ec%2Brpqmno5a5bsDWopqeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
