Whether it's a curse from <a href=#>being on a show like Seinfeld</a>, a curse from being on <a href=#>a spooky movie set</a>, or a curse from being in a particularly <a href=#>campy '80s vampire movie</a>, people are quick to point out perceived curses in entertainment.</p><p>Music fans of all ages are familiar with The Ramones and their legacy in the world of punk rock. Fewer people, however, might be up on the fact that The Ramones are a band marred by tragedy and stride. In fact, there are some who believe that the infamous punk band was cursed.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at The Ramones, and learn why some people feel as though the band is cursed.</p><h2 id=the-ramones-are-punk-pioneers-who-have-had-many-members>The Ramones Are Punk Pioneers, Who Have Had Many Members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar34299764.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With their relentless energy, catchy three-chord anthems, and iconic punk image, this quartet from Queens, New York, stormed the music scene in the mid-1970s, revolutionizing the genre and inspiring countless bands to follow suit.</p><p>Formed in 1974, The Ramones consisted of Joey Ramone (vocals), Johnny Ramone (guitar), Dee Dee Ramone (bass), and Tommy Ramone (drums). Adopting a shared surname and donning leather jackets, torn jeans, and shaggy haircuts, they created a visual identity that became synonymous with punk rock. In fact, some could argue that they are the most recognizable band of all time.</p><p>Over time, the band would include a number of other Ramones, and during their tenure together, the group was marred with loads of tension.</p><p>Sadly, The Ramones, in spite of having a massive legacy now, were never a powerhouse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Billboard charts</a>, and a number of incidents involving the band, including the passing of various members, led to some people believing that the legendary group was, in fact, cursed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seems a bit harsh, sure, but digging into their history, it's clear that quite a lot was working against the boys from New York.</p><h2 id=fans-feel-that-the-band-is-cursed>Fans Feel That The Band Is Cursed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar34246491.jpg><p>The Ramones never finding mainstream success is a shock, as is the fact that many prominent people wrote them off as a novelty. To complicate things further, one by one, the members of the group began passing away.</p><p>First, it was Joey.</p><p>"On April 15th, 2001, Joey’s family and a few friends gathered at his bedside. Doctors turned off his respirator. Mickey played a song on a boombox that Joey liked, U2’s “In a Little While” (“In a little while/This hurt will hurt no more/I’ll be home, love”). By the time the song finished, Joey Ramone had closed his eyes. He was 49," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then it was DeeDee, who passed due to an overdose at the age of 50.</p><p>Johnny eventually followed.</p><p>"On September 15th, 2004, Johnny Ramone died at his Los Angeles home, attended by his wife and some friends, at age 55. He was cremated the following January. That same month, a four-foot-tall bronze statue of the guitarist was unveiled at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery," wrote Rolling Stone.</p><p>Lastly, Tommy passed in 2014.</p><p>Just like that, The Ramones were no more.</p><p>Their story is one some feel is cursed, and to complicate things further, the group had lingering problems, which kept some key members apart.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 'Tiger King' Curse Continues With News Of Reptile Dealer Jeff Johnson's Suicide</a></span></p><h2 id=there-was-also-been-tension-between-band-members>There Was Also Been Tension Between Band Members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar34246492.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joey Ramone dealt with many health issues during the band's day, and this caused tension between he and Johnny. Mind you, the two already has massive problems thanks to a bit of infidelity.</p><p>"Johnny had a girlfriend at the time. Others began to notice that he and Linda would flirt or sometimes furtively disappear to meet each other. When Marky and Mickey Leigh each tried to tell Joey that Linda and Johnny were having an affair, he refused to believe them. According to Commando, Linda left Joey in the summer of 1982, and soon Johnny left Roxy. Johnny and Linda began living together in a Manhattan apartment, but Johnny worried that Joey would leave the band if he found out," Rolling Stone reported about the infidelity.</p><p>Regarding health concerns, the site reported on Joey's OCD, something that greatly bothered Johnny, who knew little of OCD, and what it entailed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even as Joey was on his way out, Johnny had no interest in patching things up, even going as far as saying that if the roles were reversed, he would want Joey to simply stay away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Selena Gomez Think Her Past Relationships Are Cursed</a></span></p><p>Despite their disbandment in 1996 and the unfortunate passing of all original members, The Ramones' music lives on as a testament to their enduring success. It's just a shame that the band was as snake-bitten as any act in history, and that they didn't get their flowers while they were in the prime of their career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqbWmedGapKimlah6tbTEZqSoq6RisLa%2B0p6bZpqRo7Futc1mn6KrpKS%2Funs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
