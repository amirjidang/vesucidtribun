Growing up, we are constantly scolded by our parents to wear clean underwear. At every turn, we are dressing ourselves in undergarments. Underwear is a regular part of our wardrobe. But for some rebels, going commando just feels better. That’s right, there are those people who want to free themselves of those unruly silk panties and laced thongs. There are those women who don’t ever want a pantie line and are tired of wearing uncomfortable floss-like underwear. So, their answer is to shed the annoying underwear and go commando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities are no different than regular people. They too have issues from time to time of dealing with pantie lines and uncomfortable underwear. In fact, many celebrities must put forth the sexiest front possible. They are constantly hounded by photographers who try to get them captured in the most sexiest poses one day and the most embarrassing poses the next. Therefore, it is important for celebrities to be on their game at all times. That means, no undesirable pantie lines.</p><p>Celebrities have found that shedding their underwear eliminates a lot of issues. However, at the same time, if celebrities aren’t careful, it also creates some pretty interesting impromptu photographs. In fact, many celebrities have been caught stepping out of a cab or a car lacking underwear. Be that as it may, the risk is worth the reward as there are some celebrities who just love to shed the panties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are 10 Celebrities Who Love To Go Commando.</p><h2 id=10-kendall-jenner><strong>10. Kendall Jenner</strong></h2><p>At the 2014 MuchMusic Video Awards, <a href=#>Kendall Jenner </a>shocked everyone with her red carpet dress. Jenner’s racy slit dress caused quite a stir. The dress rose up above her hips and pelvic bone to showcase her clear lack of underwear. The Fausto Puglisi gown was both stunning and eye catching. Just a few moments after hitting the red carpet, the new queen of selfies naturally snapped of photo of herself with the caption “why do one slit when you can do TWO?”</p><p>Kendall’s dress stole the show and the headlines for the award show. The paparazzi were certainly impressed as they couldn’t get enough of Jenner on the red carpet and snapped to their delight.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-miley-cyrus><strong>9. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>Naturally, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> is on this list. Forget about going commando, sometimes we wonder if Cyrus is going to keep any of her clothes on at all. Of course, the massive irony of the young singer’s career is that she began as Hannah Montana. Her hit Disney television show and character allowed Miley Cyrus to transition smoothly into music. From there, she slowly shed her Hannah Montana ways and became the rebellious Miley Cyrus. It’s not as if she has worn just a few dresses with no underwear either. There are numerous photographs that clearly show Cyrus enjoys being completely groomed below the equator. It’s no secret she has an aversion to underwear (and clothing in general).</p><p></p><h2 id=8-selena-gomez><strong>8. Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p>Add <a href=#>Selena Gomez </a>to the list of young sexy Disney starlets who have gone from their squeaky clean image to going commando. It all started on The Wizards of Waverly Place for&nbsp;Gomez who then released her first solo album. At about the same time, her relationship with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> was in full swing and making headlines. The young couple made headlines everywhere. But after their split, Bieber went out and smoked a lot of pot and got many, many tattoos while Gomez opted to remove her underwear. A curvaceous sexy Gomez now dresses the part of a young hip superstar. She regularly flaunts her curves in dresses and outfits that leave little to no room for underwear and she is more than willing to go commando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-britney-spears><strong>7. Britney Spears</strong></h2><p>Ah, <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>. Much like every other Disney star on the list, Spears went through an adjustment period during her post-Mouseketeer days. She went from young talented singer and dancer to naughty catholic school girl and super stardom. Since then, Spears has had numerous ups and downs. Some of the downs have included inebriated moments where she showed the world far more than she expected. No matter what, it is clear that when Britney goes out to have a good time, you can bet the thongs are nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-lindsay-lohan><strong>6. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>Party girls have a reputation for being a certain way. <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> has left numerous problems behind her (so we think). Whether it is stepping off of a boat or getting out of a car, you can pretty much find Lohan not wearing much under her skirts and dresses. She is a big fan of the commando look and freestyles it at any time of the day. Sundown, sun up, it doesn’t really matter. Lohan also has been photographed in party mode with nothing on underneath (shocker).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her many issues and her fight against both drug and alcohol abuse, we don’t think the lack of underwear is an issue at all. Just be more careful when you are spreading them to step out of a car. The cameras are always watching, Lindsay!</p><p></p><h2 id=5-jennifer-lopez><strong>5. Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> is a dancer and performer. She also has a very sexual Latin flare that has complimented her standout personality and gorgeous looks. J-Lo is also known for her bodacious booty. Whether it is performing on stage, walking the red carpet, or just out and about, it seems Lopez is not a big fan of underwear. In fact, with her extremely tight, skimpy outfits, there is no room for underwear. Performances are one thing, and some celebrities forgo underwear on the red carpet for awards shows, but when J-Lo showed up out in the middle of the day, recently, in blue jeans showing full clear plumber crack with no underwear in site, it's pretty clear&nbsp;J-Lo loves to go commando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-rihanna><strong>4. Rihanna</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rihanna </a>was born in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her sexy sleek look and sultry voice has catapulted her to the top of the music business. Rihanna also had a little relationship with singer <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> back in the day that made big headlines because&nbsp;Brown physically abused Rihanna. However, it is Rihanna’s voice and model-esque looks that brings her a boat-load of attention.</p><p>And normally, when Rihanna goes out, she is very comfortable in little to no clothing. The singer has been captured many times on camera wearing outfits with no bra or underwear to be seen. She is clearly very comfortable in her own skin and fortunately for the rest of the world, is also a very big sharer. Whether it’s a red carpet event, a night out on the town, or a sexy photo shoot, one thing is for certain: Rihanna always stands out and shines like a diamond wherever she goes and it is pretty much a guarantee she is going commando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-paris-hilton><strong>3. Paris Hilton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> has been in the public vernacular for so long, she almost seems old. The heiress has made a life out of being famous for being famous. She was one of the originals who blew up the Internet with ease and made a fool of herself on reality television to maintain her celebrity status. Hilton also is a big time fashion diva. She has regularly gone out in public with a variety of skimpy outfits.</p><p>Never shy about her body, this part-time model enjoys displaying her figure at all turns. She also goes pantieless whenever possible. Hilton has been caught numerous times being photographed in public without underwear. One of her most infamous moments was walking the red carpet in a gorgeous pink&nbsp;dress which pulled just to the side and showcased her full frontal groomed whoo-ha.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-kate-moss><strong>2. Kate Moss</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Moss</a> is definitely no stranger to nudity. The supermodel has made a long career out of wearing little to no clothing and showcasing her beautiful body for the world to see. So it should come as no surprise that the supermodel is not a big fan of wearing underwear. But when you go out in public, you would figure she would at least make the effort to wear some pants. While strolling the streets of London, Moss has been seen numerous times wearing outfits that barely reach below her pubic region with no pants or panties on!</p><p>In 2013, the-then 39-year-old Moss went out with high leggings, a grey top, a white fur coat, and yes, no underwear. It didn’t take much for Moss’s goods to stand out as she gave the world a full-frontal view of her favorite asset. It isn’t the first or last time Moss will be seen without underwear in public.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-kim-kardashian><strong>1. Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Although <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>’s "cootchie" has never made an accidental appearance, the world has been treated to her goods through videos and photo shoots. However, in public, Kardashian almost never wears underwear. Kardashian, who used to be friends with both Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, explained to Rolling Stone that despite her gal pals accidentally showing their goods, Kardashian really doesn’t drink and that awareness is why she doesn’t reveal herself accidentally. Kim went on to say that she “rarely wears underwear.” Keeping her faculties about her may have prevented an unwanted crotch shot from hitting the public, but boob and nip slips seem to be a thing of the norm for Kardashian. Either way, her self-professed hatred of underwear and bodacious booty have landed at number one on the commando list.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>styleblazer.com;</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>rollingout.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mo6iulWLBsHnGqGScp52irq%2Bwzmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
