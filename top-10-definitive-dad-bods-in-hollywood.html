We Love The Dad Bod! It’s All About The Dad Bod!</p><p>The term Dad Bod won the Internet last week after Clemson University sophomore, Mackenzie Pearson, wrote an essay called, Why Girls Love The Dad Bod. So what <a href=#>exactly</a> is The Dad Bod? Pearson gave Slate her official definition of men with a lack of definition:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“A dad bod is a guy who is not incredibly chiseled, but at the same time, is not unhealthy. He’s not overweight. He’s probably that guy who played football in high school and came to college and&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;play football. Maybe he had a few too many slices of pizza, or a few too&nbsp;many ramens, and just ended up with a little bit of squish on top of his muscle. It’s a healthy body. It’s a boy-next-door look. He’s the kind of person you go on a hike with, and then at the end of the day, you eat pasta and lay in bed and watch a movie.”</p><p>Here is a definitive list of the top ten Dad Bods in Hollywood. Most of these men have been considered sexy for a long some, even one from before you were probably born. Look, lady lusting after chubby guys isn't exactly a new phenomenon. The ladies have been fantasizing about every man on this list, before the Internet even put a label on it. Either way, it's now cool to admit your man doesn't need to have the body of <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> to be swoon-worthy, he just needs to eat some pizza.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-chris-pratt><strong>10. Chris Pratt</strong></h2><p>A lot of people say that <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a> started the whole Dad Bod <a href=#>craze</a>. On Parks & Recreation, Pratt played Andy. People in Pawnee didn't exactly care about physical fitness and it showed on Pratt. He was definitely pale and chubby. To be fair, he had a little chub on top of his muscle. However, Pratt lost his Dad Bod when he became a professional super hero in Guardians of The Galaxy. Sporting a six pack, a whole lot of other muscle and relatively low body fat, Pratt’s body morphed&nbsp;and he became a different kind of sex symbol.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-leonardo-dicaprio><strong>9. Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Leonard DiCaprio</a> is one of the sexiest men in Hollywood and probably the entire world. Seriously, there’s not one woman or man alive who can deny DiCaprio’s <a href=#>sexiness</a> and irresistibility. He’s also dated pretty much every supermodel who has ever existed. But, now DiCaprio has a Dad Bod. And newsflash, he’s hotter than ever. Although his Dad Bod is from beer, partying with models and generally enjoying life when he’s not on screen, as opposed to eating his kid's left over chicken fingers, that’s really okay. You don’t need to be a Dad to have a Dad Bod, you just have to enjoy life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-seth-rogen><strong>8. Seth Rogen</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Seth Rogen</a> has always had a Dad Bod. Even in his breakout role in&nbsp;Knocked Up, a lot of his lady fans wished they could get knocked up by Rogen's character, Ben. More recently, Rogen played a dad in the movie Neighbors, which&nbsp;co-starred teen heartthrobs <a href=#>Dave Franco</a> and&nbsp;<a href=#>Zac Efron</a>&nbsp;(and his six pack). There is a scene at the end of the movie where both men are shirtless standing in front of an Abercrombie & Fitch store. Efron might have harder abs, but many women think Rogen also has a sexy body (in his own 'Dad Bod' kind of way).</p><p></p><h2 id=7-jon-hamm><strong>7. Jon Hamm</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jon Hamm</a> is known for having quite a large… well… you know what we're talking about. He is also known for his Dad Bod. Hamm doesn't have any kids with his long time partner Jennifer Westfeldt, but his character on AMC’s Mad Men, Don Draper, does. While we are normally used to seeing Hamm in a suit, a recent&nbsp;picture of him on the beach revealed his shirtless Dad Bod. A little bit of a beer gut and a nice patch of chest hair made Hamm’s body one of the sexiest Dad Bods out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-alec-baldwin><strong>6. Alec Baldwin</strong></h2><p>Oh,&nbsp;<a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a>. That man is sexy no matter what he does. He’s a dad twice over and his wife Hilaria, is currently expecting another child. Baldwin had a Dad Bod before it was even cool. You might even want to say he had the original Dad Bod from back in the day. In his older films such as&nbsp;Miami Blues and The Getaway, Baldwin went shirtless and made the ladies swoon. Even when he plays totally unlikable characters, such as in his recent films&nbsp;Blue Jasmine and Still Alice, it’s still hard not to find Baldwin sexy. That man just exudes sex appeal.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-jonah-hill><strong>5.&nbsp;Jonah Hill</strong></h2><p>Okay, <a href=#>Jonah Hill</a> has kind of gone beyond the Dad Bod stage, but he’s cuddly enough to make this list. Hill is a huge fan of beer (no pun intended), which he has credited for keeping his body, well, cuddly: “I tried to be healthier. I still drink beer – that’s my Achilles’ heel I think. I went to a nutritionist and I said, ‘I’ll lose weight, I’ll eat healthier and whatever, but figure out how I can drink beer.&nbsp;Honestly, I’m not perfect, but I’m trying to be a little healthier, that’s it. It’s so annoying because if I don’t drink beer I get really thin, and then when I drink beer I get a little bigger. You should try beer, it’s really good.”&nbsp;We can all agree his humor is also an extra asset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-vince-vaughn><strong>4.&nbsp;Vince Vaughn</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a> has had a Dad Bod in pretty much every film, ever since his breakout role in Swingers. He’s also the archetype of the Dad Bod. He drinks beer and eats burritos, he works out, but probably not too hard or too often, sort of like his character in The Break Up, but less of a jerk and more of a big, cuddly teddy bear. Ladies also lusted after Vaughn’s cuddly bod in Fred Claus and of course, the classic romantic comedy Couples Retreat. Vince Vaughn exudes the sexy averageness that is the epitome of the Dad Bod.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-jack-black><strong>3. Jack Black</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jack Black</a> is a Dad with a Dad Bod and we can’t complain. Often fearless and shirtless, Black has shown off his Dad bod in a number of movies including Nacho Libre and Gulliver’s Travels. Gulliver’s Travels was also released in 3D, the D standing for Dad, of course.&nbsp;Although he has lost and gained weight over the years, with the media being no less than relentless, Black is adorable. It's fair to say his Dad Bod has kind of made his career. We couldn't imagine this dude with a Dad Bod any other way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-anthony-bourdain><strong>2.&nbsp;Anthony Bourdain</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Anthony Bourdain</a> is a silver fox with a <a href=#>Dad Bod</a>. And he knows how to cook and where to eat, in every part of the world. On both of his shows, No Reservations and Parts Unknown, Bourdain has been known to drink a beer or two, and it most definitely shows on him. If there’s one person who knows how hot Bourdain’s Dad Bod really is, it’s his wife Ottavia, who might kill you if you try to mess with her man. She is a jiu-jitsu black belt. But, just because she’s in awesome shape, doesn't mean she doesn't appreciate a fine Dad Bod.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-jason-segel><strong>1. Jason Segel</strong></h2><p>Ladies have been lusting after <a href=#>Jason Segel’s</a> Dad Bod since the days of Freaks and Geeks.&nbsp;But later in his career, for the <a href=#>Judd Apatow</a> film&nbsp;Forgetting Sarah Marshall, ladies quite enjoyed seeing Segel’s naked Dad Bod. More recently,&nbsp;Segel slimmed down his Dad Bod for the&nbsp;movie Sex Tape, telling&nbsp;Us Weekly, “This time when I take my shirt off, I've made a promise to myself, it doesn't have to be funny. I took heat for Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where I was completely nude. But different characters require different body types.” We <a href=#>prefer</a> Segel with the Dad Bod type.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>slate.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>thoughtcatalog.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>glamourmagazine.co.uk,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>sbnation.com</a>, <a href=#>eonline.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5w56doqaZqba3sYydmJ1lkqSxtHnIp2Shp5yhxri7zp1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
