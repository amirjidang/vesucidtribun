Instead, she is joining GAC Family’s When Hope Calls, a spinoff.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>“Full House” – Why Lori Loughlin and John Stamos Never Ended up Together</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Hallmark Channel has not cast Lori Loughlin in any current projects, including When Calls the Heart, nor do we have any plans to cast her in the future. She was cast by GAC Family, a wholly separate cable network not affiliated with Hallmark Channel or Crown Media Family Networks," Hallmark said in a statement.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallmark fired Loughlin</a> from <a href=#>her job</a> due to her role in a&nbsp;nationwide bribery scandal.

They eventually took a plea deal and pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.</p><p>Loughlin was sentenced to <a href=#>two months in prison</a>, a $150,000 fine, and 100 hours of community service.
