This includes his comments during his outstanding interview on The Howard Stern Show on May 14th, 2024. During this, <strong>Blanco claimed that he doesn't get jealous of Gomez hooking up with her co-stars while filming scenes.</strong> Prior to this, both <strong>he and Gomez spilled some major T about their intimate life</strong>, specifically how NSFW it is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanc.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Daily Mail, a source close to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selena Gomez believes that she has found "the one" in Benny Blanco</strong></a> and plans to marry him and have kids. However, this is unconfirmed. What is confirmed is just how fiery her love life is with Blanco. According to TheNews.com, the couple are avid cooks and love spoiling each other with meals. But Blanco cooks for Gomez for one specific reason... <strong>making her food gets him "laid".</strong></p><ul><li>Benny Blanco' released a cookbook in May 2024 called "Open Wide"</li><li>Benny Blanco's real name is Benjamin Levin</li></ul><p>Blanco took to his Instagram to share an image of a steak dinner he had made Gomez. In the caption, the musician and music producer wrote the following:</p><p>"I woke up early this morning and I was like: 'I want to do something nice for my girlfriend'.

This is something pretty abnormal as Gomez has traditionally been pretty quiet about this topic due to her younger fanbase. However, during the launch of Blano's new cookbook, "Open Wide", she pulled the curtain back even further. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gomez posted an image of herself suggestively licking a cake with a depiction of Blanco</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/selena-gomez-3-1.jpg><p>These images just add to<strong> fan theories about their intimate life based on their body language</strong>. Both Blanco and Gomez have posted numerous images of the two of them engaging in PDA. So much so that body language experts have weighed in on their relationship, according to Women's Health. Karen Donaldson, a body language expert, told Women's Health that all of the energy between Gomez and Blanco is legitimate and not played up for the cameras.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/benny-blanco-and-selena-gomez.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Selena Gomez Refuses To Let Paparazzi See Her Makeup-Free Face In Awkward Outing With Benny Blanco">Selena Gomez Refuses To Let Paparazzi See Her Makeup-Free Face In Awkward Outing With Benny Blanco</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Selena wasn't feeling herself in new photos showing the couple leaving an NYC studio, sparking speculation about a new project.</p><p>Donaldson made numerous observations based on images both candid and posed of the two music superstars. Among her observations is that the two are extremely comfortable in each other's presence. She pointed to images of Gomez leaning on Blanco's shoulder and how the couple often have their hands intertwined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanc.jpeg><p>"It kind of showcases a strong emotional intimacy as well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are also on "the same page" in their relationship</strong>, according to body language expert Karen Donaldson.

An image of Blanco gently kissing Gomez's wrist as she looks away from him shows that he is constantly "expressing his love" for her. Of course, his actions prove this even more. Including how he always cooks for her and even brings her meals to the set of the latest season of Only Murders In The Building. Blanco, who is of Jewish descent, also included Gomez at a star-studded Passover dinner in April 2024, celebrating the Jews' exodus from slavery in Egypt and return to the land of Israel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-meet>How Did Selena Gomez And Benny Blanco Meet?</h2><p><strong>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco were secretly dating for six months before they publicly announced their relationship</strong> in December 2023. But their relationship dates back far longer than that. According to Elle,<strong> Gomez and Blanco met through her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber.</strong> This is back in 2009, a year before Bieber and Gomez set the world on fire with their on-again-off-again relationship. At the time, Blanco was working with Bieber as a producer as well as with a variety of other musical artists that ran in their circle. This includes The Weeknd (who also later dated Gomez) and Camila Cabello.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blanco later stated that he did not have any romantic or sexual feelings toward the much younger Selena Gomez when they first met, as well as when they first worked together in 2015. This is when he produced her 2015 songs, "Same Old Love" and "Kill 'Em With Kindness." The pair collaborated again in 2017 with Cashmere Cat on "Trust Nobody".</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Chris Rock And Selena Gomez Have One Of The Strangest Celebrity Feuds">Chris Rock And Selena Gomez Have One Of The Strangest Celebrity Feuds</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Chris Rock calling Selena Gomez out was something that virtually nobody could have predicted.</p><p>Blanco and Gomez continued to work together in 2019 and in August 2023, with "I Can't Get Enough" and "Single Soon", respectively.
