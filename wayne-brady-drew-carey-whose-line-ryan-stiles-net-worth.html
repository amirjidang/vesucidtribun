Starting as a radio program in the U.K., which evolved into a highly popular series on British Television’s Channel 4, which in turn evolved into the American version that began airing in 1998, the show has hosted at least 2 dozen different comedians in its roster, including Late Show host Stephen Colbert and the beloved late Robin Williams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Colin Mochrie Defends Himself From Fan Using A VHS Tape</a></span></p><p>The American version originally aired on ABC, but after its end in 2006, it was rebooted on the CW in 2009 and has remained on the air ever since, albeit with a different host and some new guests. But, ever since the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? became popular, three names have been attached to the show in audiences' minds; Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, and Ryan Stiles. In addition to the big three, several other contemporary comics like the always sarcastic Greg Proops, have been regular guests. Other notable guest stars include Keegan Michael Key, Whoopi Goldberg, and several more. Not only has the show yielded many big names as contributors, but it has also yielded a healthy living for the series regulars and <a href=#>helped them further their careers as film, TV, and comedy stars</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=honorable-mention---drew-carey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Honorable Mention - Drew Carey</span></h2><p>The host of The Price Is Right was instrumental in bringing the show to American audiences, and he did so when his sitcom The Drew Carey Show was at the height of its popularity. Although he is not really involved in The CW reboot, as the host that American audiences came to know first, he deserves an honorable mention. Carey is definitely the richest of any of the Whose Line? stars as <a href=#>he claims a net worth of $165 million.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Drew Carey Spends His $165 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=jeff-davis---0-4-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jeff Davis - $0.4 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeff Davis, one of the show's frequent guest stars, has the lowest net worth at the moment with only $400,000 to his name. Unlike his other castmates, Davis doesn’t do much outside of improv comedy. He was, however, a part of Drew Carey’s other improv show, Drew Carey’s Improvaganza, which used to air on the Game Show Network. He is also a podcaster.</p><h2 id=colin-mocherie---1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Colin Mocherie - $1 Million</span></h2><p>Colin Mochrie, despite being with the show ever since its days on British television, has a fairly modest net worth at only $1 million. However, it’s important to remember that Colin Mochrie lives most of the year in his homeland of Canada, and in Canadian dollars, Mochrie is worth a little bit more than in American. In Canadian currency, he has $1.2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-sherwood---1-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brad Sherwood - $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Another frequent guest star, Sherwood regularly tours with his improv act outside of the Whose Line? seasons. He also joins some of his castmates on tours, like when he and Colin Mochrie teamed up for a tour in the mid-2010s.</p><h2 id=chip-esten---4-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chip Esten - $4 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two of the Whose Line? regular guest stars are in a tie with both claiming a $4 million net worth. Chip Esten is one of those two. In addition to his work on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Drew Carey’s Improvaganza, Esten had a brief recurring role on The Office and is a musician with a lovely singing voice. In 2018 he was added to the Guinness Book Of World Records for releasing<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the most consecutive singles as he released once a week on Twitter for almost 60 weeks</a>.</p><h2 id=greg-proops---4-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Greg Proops - $4 Million</span></h2><p>Stand-up comic Greg Proops is the other Whose Line? regular with $4 million to his name. Proops has been on the standup circuit for over 20 years and was with the show when it was on British television. Proops is also an actor and has been in shows and films like Flight of the Conchords and Star Wars. As a standup comic, he is very popular in England.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Comedy Legend George Carlin's Final Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=aisha-tyler---8-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aisha Tyler - $8 Million</span></h2><p>Tyler replaced Carey as host for the CW reboot and brings a different energy to the show than Carey did. Carey kept the show more true to the British version by picking a winner based on the “points” allocated each episode (which don’t matter *wink*) but Tyler is looser with the show. Instead of picking winners and joining in on the games the way Carey did, Tyler just occasionally pops in on a game when it tickles her fancy.</p><h2 id=ryan-stiles---8-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ryan Stiles - $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with Mochrie, Stiles is one of the longest-running and most popular castmates on the show. He has a slightly larger net worth because, in addition to his work on the show, he is a regular character actor for sitcoms and movies. He’s had roles on The Drew Carey Show,Two and A Half Men, Young Sheldon, Reno 911, and several more. He also collects some major residuals from his film career. Stiles had a bit role in Charlie Sheen’s classic comedy Hot Shots and Hot Shots Part Deux.</p><h2 id=wayne-brady---12-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wayne Brady - $12 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should come as no surprise that Wayne Brady is the richest of the Whose Line? crew. In addition to hosting the game show Let’s Make A Deal, Brady used to have a talk show and is a very popular musician. <a href=#>He won the second season of </a><a href=#>The Masked Singer,</a> recorded a hit single in 2020, and has taken to TikTok to speak out on racial justice issues. He has been getting consistent acting work outside of Whose Line? for years now.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> A Look At Wayne Brady's Relationship With His Ex-Wife</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumrGemnqjvsCdsGacoprEbq%2FAq5yyZaedvLSxjKWgp51dp8aiuoysq6Kklah6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
