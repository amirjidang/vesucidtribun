It's not a secret that Doja Cat has always been a fan of Nicki Minaj, and she has repeatedly praised the Super Bass rapper several times. However, fans think something is going on between Doja and Megan, and it has a lot to do with Nicki Minaj and Cardi B. What in the rap universe is going on? And how did Doja Cat possibly get betrayed by Megan?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2020, Doja got super emotional praising Nicki in a video where she said, "And then you have Nicki... She has implanted herself so deeply into all of us and into music. In a very sad way, people have underappreciated her." Then she added, "I think that she just belongs in the spotlight, and she should be heard." When Nicki also mentioned Doja on Queen Radio, Doja went live and said that "amazing" couldn't even begin to describe how she felt. She also admitted that Nicki was her inspiration from day one, and she continues to be a huge fan of the rapper. Apparently, Doja refused to collab with Megan because she betrayed Nicki. Are Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat actually friends? Keep reading to find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-megan-thee-stallion-and-doja-cat-friends>Are Megan Thee Stallion And Doja Cat Friends?</h2><p>The tea spilling began when The Vault Uncut captioned an Instagram post, "The shade is real! Doja Cat told her team to tell Megan Thee Stallion's team 'no, thank you' to them ever working on music together again after Megan reached out to Doja Cat." Then the account added, "while Doja Cat didn't give Megan an explanation as to why, my source told me, the real tea is she refuses to work with Megan because she's loyal to Nicki Minaj and she knows Nicki isn't feeling Megan no more at all." Is Megan really on team Cardi and not team Nicki?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Megan Thee Stallion's Tory Lanez Diss At Coachella Was A Big Deal</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan previously teamed up with Nicki for her 2019 hit Hot Girl Summer, and she even talked about how Nicki was a fantastic contribution to the hit. In 2019, Megan also made it clear that she did not pick sides between Nicki and Cardi and that it was like the fans that continued to pit them against each other." Megan told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News: Daily Pop</a>, "I really, really, really like both of them. They're two different people, two different rappers. It's not even the same. I feel like we need to stop trying to compare them."</p><p>However, fans noticed a change after Megan collaborated with Cardi B on the single WAP a year later, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Consequently, people started saying that Megan was officially team Cardi after that.</p><h2 id=is-there-beef-between-megan-thee-stallion-doja-cat-and-nicki-minaj>Is There Beef Between Megan Thee Stallion, Doja Cat And Nicki Minaj?</h2><p>To fuel the narrative even further, <a href=#>Nicki unfollowed Megan in January 2021, and they were labeled as rivals</a>. Then, in January 2022, fans noticed that Megan had unfollowed Nicki and Doja Cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to fans, Doja is still on team Nicki, and because she believed Megan is on team Cardi, she refused to do a collab with Megan. That was not a clever move to some people, considering Nicki allegedly shaded Doja in December 2021. Barbz (devoted fans of Nicki Minaj) blasted Doja Cat for not wishing Nicki a happy birthday when she turned 39 on December 8th. One fan wrote, "Doja Cat, since you didn't tell Nicki Minaj happy birthday, please stop using her style, image, flow, animation, and visuals. You just another Megan that used her."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Fallout From Doja Cat's Decision To Quit Music</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki later posted a cryptic yet similar message on her own page</a>, seemingly agreeing that Doja was just a copycat. The Harajuku Barbie wrote a quick message that has since been deleted: "Copiers can't even say HBD chi. Lol this song go."</p><h2 id=why-did-nicki-minaj-not-collab-with-doja-cat>Why Did Nicki Minaj Not Collab With Doja Cat?</h2><p>Other people pointed out that although Doja was willing to forgo a collab with Megan yet, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki refused to collab with her in her song Get into It (Yuh)</a> in September 2021. <a href=#>Nicki spoke about her decision to pass on the opportunity to join Doja Cat on her music</a> and explained that she didn't feel like she could add to the song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said, "The truth is, she asked me to get on that song. It's not that I'm too busy at all." Nicki also explained that she requested another song to be sent to her, adding, "So I asked them to send me something else. I think that was the second song they sent me, but I asked them to send me something else, and they didn't send me anything else." Leaving behind <a href=#>the drama between team Nicki and team Cardi</a>, it's clear that Doja and Megan have a complicated relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion’s Record Label Sued Her For Doing This</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dorKorc1mq6GdlWLAta3LpaCopl2Wu6V5w6ihmmWTlsFurcKtrJqknK56p77InqWdq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
