Kroy claims that Kim has exhibited “troubling behavior” leading up to the divorce. He says that Kim has a “compulsion” with online gambling games that’s financially ruined their family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyonce & Jay-Z Drop $200 Million On California’s Most Expensive Home</a></span></p><p>The publication adds that Kroy believes Kim’s addiction is exacerbated by “underlying mental health issues like depression, anxiety, narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar disorder or ADHD.”</p><p>He went so far as to claim that Kim’s gambling problem is interfering with her ability to care for their four minor children.</p><p>Kim has also made a variety of allegations against Kroy. Last week, she requested that the court order her estranged husband to <a href=#>undergo a drug test</a>. She expressed concern that his cannabis usage impacts his ability to care for their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim originally filed for divorce at the end of April, describing their marriage as “irretrievably broken.” Though she’s seeking primary physical custody of their minor kids, Kim requested joint legal custody as well as spousal support.</p><p>However, they may not be a lot of money to around. The former couple’s financial problems have been highly publicized. Earlier this month, it was reported <a href=#>the pair owe $1 million in back due taxes</a> to the IRS. Moreover, their Georgia mansion recently went into foreclosure after they defaulted on a loan they took out in 2012.</p><p>Kim denied the foreclosure for months on social media, until the bank took possession and put the estate up for auction earlier this month.</p><p>"There's no cheating on either side. The money has a lot to do with the split, but there were other factors," a source told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> of Kim and Kroy’s split. "He's been managing [the family] for a long time, so he technically did have a job. They're not on good terms right now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kroy and Kim married on 2011 and their relationship has been followed on a number of reality shows, including their own series Don’t Be Tardy. They share four minor kids 9-year-old twins Kaia and Kane, 10-year-old son Kash, and 11-year-old Kroy Jr. Kroy also adopted Kim’s older daughters –Brielle, 26, and Ariana, 21 – from previous relationships. The former couple’s divorce remains ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Bre Tiesi Claims Nick Cannon Has Too Many Kids To Pay Child Support</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4s7vYZpminaKirq%2B6jJyjmqGdqHqstcxmsaikk56urL%2BMoJimmpyeu6h5wpqsrJ2UYrOqusCnmqKZnGLBs7vUm6Oeq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
