Jacques and Raymond were so crisp in the ring. They also knew how to be completely annoying heels.

Nowadays, in AEW, his own band’s theme plays him to the ring with the song "Judas." For most of his WWE career, Jericho entered the ring with the Y2J theme that Jim Johnston had composed. But, for the WWE Album "Forceable Entry," he and Fozzy co-founder Rich Ward teamed up with Johnston for a new theme that Jericho used for a while, “Don’t You Wish You Were Me.”</p><h2 id=koko-b-ware><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Koko B.

During The Expansion Era, few wrestlers did that better than Koko B. Ware. He’d strut and dance to the ring with his faithful bird, Frankie, but he’d also sang his iconic theme song, “The Birdman.” There's no way to hear this song and not start feeling positive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeff-hardy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeff Hardy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-148.jpeg><p>With so many different interests, Jeff Hardy has always had a hard time just focusing on wrestling.

With his mammoth frame, beard, and long hair, Jim could have easily been presented as a monster heel for Hulk Hogan to run through. But, instead, he was a fun-loving, big ol' Country Boy. That mentality played out in his own theme song “Don’t Go Messing With A Country Boy.” He’d often have a hoedown in the middle of the ring to the tune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-quebecers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Quebecers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-150.jpeg><p>Years before PCO reinvented himself and became an independent sensation, he had a stint in WWE. First as a pirate, he had greater success as one half of the Quebecers, alongside The Mountie himself, Jacques Rougeau. Rougeau, no stranger to singing his own theme song, sang his third one here.
