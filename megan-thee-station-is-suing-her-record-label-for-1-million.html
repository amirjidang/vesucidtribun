However, it adds that a “new dispute has arisen requiring further assistance from the Court."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The details of Megan’s dispute with 1505 Certified Entertainment are not clear. However, the complaint reveals her label record <a href=#>argued Something for Thee Hotties doesn’t qualify as a full album</a>, and so they won’t release her from her contract yet. The label reportedly only told her this after the album was released.</p><p>The complaint claims the record label is trying to “take further advantage” of Megan “at great expense and in bad faith.”</p><p>So far, Megan’s legal team hasn’t publicly commented on the new filing. However, 1505 Certified Entertainment’s lawyers have issued a public statement. They don’t deny that they had a problem with Megan’s second last album, stating it features spoken word archival content and was released too soon <a href=#>following her debut album </a>Good News, which released in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our belief is she owes us one more album, at least,” they lawyer, Steven M. Zager, stated.</p><p>The record label says it’s still evaluating whether Traumazine meets their criteria of a full album.</p><p>Shortly after Good News released, Megan filed a lawsuit against her record label in March 2020. At the time, she says their relationship took a turn for the worse after she tried to renegotiate her contract. She claims the label then allegedly prevented her from releasing new music.</p><p>“When I signed, I didn’t really know what was in my contract. I was young. I was like 20,” Megan said at the time. “It’s really just a greedy game.” At the time, she said she didn’t want to leave the record label, but simply wanted to renegotiate her contract for future releases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court eventually <a href=#>granted her a temporary restraining order</a>, which allowed her to drop new music. The following year, she sued her record label again over BTS’s song “Butter,” which her vocals are featured on. Megan was granted an injunction.</p><p>They say third time is the charm, so maybe this most recent lawsuit will finally end Megan’s working relationship with 1505 once and for all.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>‘Teen Mom 2’ Star Leah Messer New BF Proposed With 4-Carat Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Pitchfork</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prPAp2StoJWaerTAwK2gqKZdnsBuv9SipaBlmJq%2Fbr7EnKarnF2hrqOxy2adqKpdZnqutculoKimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
