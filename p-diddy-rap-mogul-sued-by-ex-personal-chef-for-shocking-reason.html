Diddy: Rap Mogul Sued By Ex Personal Chef For Shocking Reason</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-31</div><p>The American rapper cum business tycoon Sean John Combs, aka P. Diddy, has&nbsp;been dragged to court by his former cook who sought&nbsp;an unspecified amount in damages for allegations.</p><p>Cindy Rueda claimed she worked overtime without due pay and made uneasy by serving meals after sex parties. According to Rueda, she sometimes&nbsp;worked from 9 am to 2 am as she cooked at the Los Angeles home of Diddy formerly known as Puff Daddy. P. Diddy has denied the allegation of&nbsp;sexual harassment and failure to pay overtime wages.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in a Los Angeles court on Monday, May 8. It alleged that Ms Rueda was once&nbsp;summoned by Mr. Combs to serve him a ‘post-coital meal’ in which he made suggestive remarks. A statement from the document said the 47-year old would ask the chef &nbsp;“to prepare and serve entrees and appetizers to him and his guests while Mr. Combs and his guests were engaged in or immediately following sexual activity.”</p><p>On one occasion, she said&nbsp;a naked male visitor entered the kitchen as she cooked and asked her “to look at and admire his genitals after the dude had engaged in sexual activity with another house guest.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the attorney representing P. Diddy in the case dismissed the allegation quote:</p><p>“This is a frivolous&nbsp;lawsuit by a disgruntled ex-employee who was fired for cause.”</p><p>The chef confirmed she was fired in 2016 after being accused of theft. According to Rueda, she had taken a watch which&nbsp;Diddy’s housekeeper said was found in the garbage and that she was given a chance to keep it if she renounced her complaints.</p><p>But that’s not all the complaint coming from the chef. Her paycheck each day as Diddy’s personal chef was $150 even if she worked late or travelled with him.</p><p>She also said she was offered a full-time job in June 2015 but declined due to “unreasonable hours and pay.”</p><p>In another court paperwork released in July 2017, Combs’ lawyer blasted the wrongful termination lawsuit filed by chef Cindy Rueda in May as a shakedown attempt that violated her agreement to arbitrate any employment disputes.</p><p>He said&nbsp;Combs enterprises will not be extorted, adding that&nbsp;Rueda’s lawsuit was infected with distortions, omissions and outright falsehoods.</p><p>“Your motives are clear: To threaten to slander and impugn the reputation of our client in the hopes of extracting a settlement. This smacks of bad faith — and worse,” Snyder wrote.</p><p>Combs filed the letter as an exhibit to a petition to compel arbitration in the case.</p><p>Currently, on the top list of Forbes richest Hip-Hop artists, 2017 with a net worth of $820 million,&nbsp;the extremely successful entrepreneur seem to have explored every potential money breeder including fashion, beverages, cosmetics etc.</p><p>Not to mention his music career with&nbsp;strings of successful albums starting in the 1990s.</p><p>It was also reported in 2003 that P. Diddy&nbsp;had ordered better conditions for workers in Honduras after activists found sweatshop conditions in the production of his Sean John clothing line.</p><p>Sean Combs recently tweeted that he will now no longer be answering to Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy, Diddy or any other names but ‘Love a.k.a. Brother Love’.</p><p>“I have some very very serious news,” he said in a Twitter video. “I been praying on this and I decided – I know it’s risky because it could come off as corny to some people… I decided to change my name again.”</p><p>“I’m just not who I am before, I’m something different, so my new name is Love aka Brother Love. I will not be answering to Puffy, Diddy, Puff Daddy or any of my other monickers but Love or Brother Love.”</p><p>Explaining the decision, he said he is feeling like a different person to any of the people previously designated in his lengthy list of titles.</p><p>This is not his first he is changing his name, in 2005, he switched from P. Diddy to just Diddy. According to him, this was to help fans cheer him on when he is performing on stage. “I felt the ‘P’ was coming between me and my fans, half the crowd chanting ‘Diddy.’ Now everybody can just chant ‘Diddy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKhdmbalsNhmqZqoXaK8qMHLZqqunZRir7p5xLFkqZ2iqLyvrctmmqGdlmKzsL6MrJ%2Bom5ueu6h50Z6YrKeeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
