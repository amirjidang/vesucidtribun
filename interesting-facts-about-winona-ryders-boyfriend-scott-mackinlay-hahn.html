The image of her and Johnny Depp both clad in black has come to represent the epitome of '90s chic. Meanwhile, many people are still Winona and <strong><a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a>,</strong> stans and although the two were never anything more than friends, fans were delighted to hear that Winona and Keanu may actually be married. Well, sort of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days the actress has moved away from her erstwhile cooler-than-thou persona and leads a relatively normal life, or as normal as you can get as a Hollywood superstar. Subsequently, she has <a href=# rel=nofollow>settled down with Scott Mackinlay Hahn</a>, who has been her beau for a while now. But what do we know about her silvery-haired significant other? It turns out that he leads a pretty fascinating life!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What David Harbour's Life Was Like Before Stranger Things</a></span></p><h2 id=bono-may-have-matched-scott-mackinlay-hahn-and-winona-ryder><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Bono May Have Matched Scott Mackinlay Hahn And Winona Ryder</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar44004032.jpg><p>There are many perks to being a celebrity, one of which is mingling with world-famous rock stars. In Ryder's case, she has been close friends with U2 front-man Bono since the '90s, and it's quite possible that he was responsible for bringing the couple together. Hahn previously worked with Bono, so it's likely that they met through the Irish rocker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Bono may not have exactly been a matchmaker and set them up on a date, Ryder and Hahn's separate connections to the musician seems like a very likely way for them to have met especially considering how the two come for very different realms of life.</p><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-is-a-fashion-designer><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Is A Fashion Designer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar47179665.jpg><p>Clearly, Hahn is a busy man. He is the owner of not one, but two NYC-based fashion brands, ROGAN and Loomstate. It appears as though ROGAN has been inactive since 2013, with Hahn devoting his time to Loomstate, which sells minimalist and monochromatic clothing for both men and women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One such reason for ROGAN's dissolution appears to be its lack of sustainability. As Hahn told Fashion Etc, "The aesthetic results were art-based and sculptural, although the environmental and business aspects were not sustainable."</p><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-campaigns-against-fast-fashion><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Campaigns Against Fast Fashion</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50373678.jpg><p>In recent years, there has been a heightened awareness of the ethical concerns regarding fast fashion. Specifically, sweatshop labor and multinational brands' refusal to pay their workers a living wage have been at the heart of sustainable fashion campaigns.</p><p>Hahn is one such individual promoting slow, sustainable fashion and condemning fast fashion. On Good On You, a website devoted to brand transparency, Loomstate gets the highest possible rating for sustainability. Moreover, in 2011, he was one of the judges in the "Trim the Waste of Fashion" competition and discussed realistic goals for change within the fashion community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-scott-mackinlay-hahn-on-social-media><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Is Scott Mackinlay Hahn On Social Media?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51534083.jpg><p>Hahn does use social media, but sparingly, which is apt for someone devoted to a "less is more" ethos. He hasn't been active on Twitter since 2017 and the account has very few followers. Meanwhile, Loomstate's Instagram account hasn't seen any action since 2018. We're not sure why Hahn has been so inactive online, but it certainly adds to his mysterious persona.</p><p>His reasoning for exiting social media may have to do with his preference for keeping his personal life private from the public eye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>This Is What Scott Mackinlay Hahn Really Does For A Living</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-advocates-for-climate-action><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Advocates For Climate Action</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar44005652.jpg><p>When Hahn was active on Twitter, he used the site to raise awareness to causes close to his heart. For instance, much of his account centered on climate change. In 2017, he Tweeted about the importance of clean air: "Clean power is the energy of choice for a resilient and successful business." Some celebs like to use their platform for good, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>climate change is an issue that a number of famous people</a> have raised concerns about.</p><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-spends-his-free-time-out-in-nature><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Spends His Free Time Out In Nature</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50371905.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he isn't campaigning for climate action and sustainability or joining his girlfriend on the red carpet, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hahn likes to unwind with some body-surfing and forestry</a>. The latter is the practice of conserving forests, so even in his free time, he is committed to environmental causes. Evidently, his sensitive and nature-loving persona was attractive to Ryder.</p><h2 id=how-long-have-winona-ryder-amp-scott-mackinlay-hahn-been-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Long Have Winona Ryder & Scott Mackinlay Hahn Been Together?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar46602632.jpg><p>Long-lasting celeb couples are becoming increasingly scarce in Hollywood. Thankfully, Hahn and Ryder are not among them. The pair have actually been together since 2011, though they have kept their romance rather low-key.</p><p>Since their relationship is so private, it is unknown what kind of turmoil they have faced within their relationship. They are still going strong, however, and seem to have a very solid relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-is-a-very-private-person><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Is A Very Private Person</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51534670.jpg><p>Ever since her 2001 shoplifting incident thrust her unfavorably into the media spotlight, Ryder has remained a private person and her beau has followed suit. The couple rarely speaks about their relationship. They prefer to keep their relationship to themselves, just like <a href=# rel=nofollow>many other celebrities keep their personal lives private</a>.</p><p>In interviews, Hahn eschews questions about his private life in favor of discussing his mission to help create a more ethical fashion industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Does Winona Ryder's Boyfriend Really Feel About Her A-List Exes?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-promotes-feminism><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Promotes Feminism</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar46265473.jpg><p>Since fast fashion predominantly affects women (80% of garment workers are women), it is not surprising that Hahn's belief system is intertwined with feminism. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hahn is a supporter of feminism</a> and often posted about women's rights on his Twitter. In particular, he frequently wrote about the disadvantaged experiences of women and girls within the developing world.</p><h2 id=scott-mackinlay-hahn-is-younger-than-winona-ryder><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Scott Mackinlay Hahn Is Younger Than Winona Ryder</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar44004763.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his gray hair and matching beard, Hahn looks years older than Ryder. But in actuality, he is almost a decade younger than his youthful-looking girlfriend. According to the website Married Biography, he was born in October 1980, while a Bustle article from September 2017 posts that he is in his late 30s. Although Ryder looks considerably younger, she is turning 51 this October.</p><h2 id=will-scott-mackinlay-hahn-ever-propose-to-winona-ryder><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Scott Mackinlay Hahn Ever Propose To Winona Ryder?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winona-ryder-and-scott-mackinlay-hahn.jpg><p>The couple has been together for over ten years, so it is no surprise that fans have been wondering whether Scott will ever pop the question. Though sources close to Ryder dished that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">actress is definitely ready for marriage</a> back in 2020, that might not exactly be the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryder and Scott certainly get on brilliantly, so it seems a no-brainer that marriage should ultimately be the next step. However, the couple is enjoying how their lives are now. They love being out of the spotlight and giving fans little-to-no information about their relationship, so much so that they randomly have to confirm they are still together.</p><p>Ryder explained she would <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rather remain a girlfriend than possibly face another divorce</a>. The couple sported matching outfits on the runway for the Stranger Things season 4 premier earlier this year, proving that they are still going strong even if marriage is not in the cards for them. At the end of the day, Ryder and Scott are happy and that is all that matters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6yVp7K0wMinnmaekZjBtHnAm6aurF2stq%2B7zZpkq7GUmr%2B0ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnSnKatrF2irqS3yKejmrFdna6puo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
