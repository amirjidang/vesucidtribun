There are many families that have lost their loved ones in train accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>It is tragic for them, but some of them manage to get back on track to support their family. On the other hand, there are families who lose their father or mother or the bread earner of the family, and they face a lot of challenges ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar case we witnessed when the <a href=#>news</a> broke on social media and local media about the train accident. Jaclyn Michelle, the mother of six children, was walking near Rooty Hill, in Sydney’s west, at about 7.45 pm last Monday.</p><p>The incident is unknown, but she accidentally got struck by a train. She was immediately rushed to the hospital and later announced dead.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident was very unfortunate for the children as the family already had the father missing from the family photo. And now, with their mother gone, the six children are suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are the names of Jaclyn Michelle’s children:</p><ul><li><strong>Hemmi</strong> (15)</li><li><strong>Jordan</strong> (13)</li><li><strong>Isabella</strong> (11)</li><li><strong>Sienna</strong> (7)</li><li><strong>Isack</strong> (6)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>McKenzie</strong> (2)</li></ul><p>Her incident was very unfortunate, and the children are now separated. Some children stay with Michelle’s sister ‘Samantha’ and some stay with their mother.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this act was as the six children couldn’t stay in one home due to lack of space.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the family struggles to find ways to stay on top of their monthly bills. They have been dealing with a lot of financial issues since Michell’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>On 17 October 2022, Jaclyn’s funeral is scheduled, and we want to do something for the family in their difficult times.</p><p>Jackie O & Kyle reported that they would be donating <strong>$10,000</strong> in hopes that this will help the family through this difficult time.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wJyjsqZdoraktMSlo55lm565rbHDZpmyZaSnrqq6jJqanKGUmru1ecCtZKunn6nGbrTIpaNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
