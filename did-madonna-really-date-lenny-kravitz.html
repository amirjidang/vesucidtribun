One of them was her Justify My Love co-writer Lenny Kravitz, <a href=#>who also worked with Jennifer Lopez</a>. The song itself has also fueled suspicion among the public regarding the duo’s true relationship. But did Madonna really date Lenny?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Is Jason Momoa To Wife Lisa Bonet’s Ex-Husband, Lenny Kravitz?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-was-madonna-and-lenny-kravitz-rsquo-s-relationship-like>What Was Madonna And Lenny Kravitz’s Relationship Like?</h2><p>Occasional music collaborators, Madonna and Lenny Kravitz were reported to have been lovers at one point back in 1990. The duo was said to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fallen for one another during their recording session</a>. From the sound of such reports, their love life (emphasis on the love part) did not survive past a simple fling together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to co-writer Ingrid Chavez in an interview with Vibe, Lenny Kravitz and Andre Betts collaborated on composing the music. Chavez read from a letter she'd written, which created the song's lyrics. They swiftly recorded it and had what would become the blockbuster single in one take.</p><p>Furthermore, Kravitz mentioned in an interview that he'd been working on demos, and the recorded version of Justify My Love came up. And, while he liked the song, he didn't believe it was a suitable fit for him. Since he had been touring with Madonna, he believed it would be a good fit for her.</p><p>So, he called her and informed her that he had a hit for her. She came to the studio, heard it, and asked him to play it a second time. At that point, she told him she wanted to record it, which they did the following day. Because of their collaborations, many thought the two were in a romantic relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Accident Led To Madonna’s Iconic Butt-Flashing 1984 VMAs Performance</a></span></p><p>However, the Oscar winner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kravitz spilled tea on the truth</a> about his relationship with Madonna. He set the record straight on if he ever dated the singer or if their friendship ever evolved into something more. Speaking to Andy Cohen’s show, he revealed: “It never did. That’s the truth. [We’ve] always been really good friends.”</p><p>While Kravitz admitted that they never dated, Madonna recalled in an interview with Howard Stern that she was deeply attracted to Kravitz. And though she, too, would not share any intimate details, the two had some <a href=#>electricity that never survived back then</a>. However, whatever moment they shared led to some undeniably beautiful music and powerful pop music history.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madonna Claims She Turned Down “The Best Movie Ever”</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-songs-did-lenny-kravitz-write-for-madonna>What Songs Did Lenny Kravitz Write For Madonna?</h2><p>Lenny Kravitz, a well-known American songwriter and rock idol singer, has written a “hot” song, Justify My Love, for Madonna. Interestingly, the track became a huge pop smash even though it isn’t really a pop song. It was one of the most successful and contentious songs of the early 1990s, fueled by public indignation over a sexual music video that was removed from many networks.</p><p>Rolling Stone reports Jean-Baptiste Mondino, the director of the Justify My Love video, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was taken with the song</a>, calling it “very, very progressive, very unusual. It was Lenny Kravitz who wrote it, he was singing, but he was almost talking, and he had that strange beat. You couldn’t really dance to it. It was all whispering — it sounds more like an experience. Nobody would pick up a song like this and try to make a hit out of it, don’t you think so?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Mondino did not anticipate anyone attempting to make it a hit, Madonna did. Madonna not only released it, but she also made it the first single off her first greatest hits album, The Immaculate Collection. Given that Justify My Love is somewhat avant garde for a mainstream song, that was probably a risk.</p><p>After that, the risk paid off, as the song went on to become one of Madonna's biggest singles of all time, topping the Billboard Hot 100. It's amazing how Madonna's musical style transitioned from her early dance-pop singles to the minimalist trip-hop of Justify My Love didn't alienate the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Madonna’s Justify My Love is widely regarded as one of the best pop songs ever released by celebrity musicians. Meanwhile, Kravitz also considers the song his first No.1 single. He also cited it as one of the songs which defined his life alongside his own hits like American Woman and Fly Away. It’s certainly one of Madonna and Lenny Kravitz’s many iconic songs.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Madonna Pays This Much To Keep Her Hands Wrinkle-Free</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq6lu82nmGaqlZa5rcWMnZitnV2hsq%2B62Gaiq5mmnsG7ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
