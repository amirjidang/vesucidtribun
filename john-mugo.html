His friend and colleague announced the sad news in a post on Facebook.</p><h2>What happened to John Mugo?</h2><p>John Mugo, a Kenyan travel nurse, was on an assignment in a New York hospital and has been reported missing. According to the reports, he had recently started a nursing assignment and was preparing to fly home to Atlanta, Georgia, on December 24, 2023. But he never made it home; his family reported to the authorities, and a</p><p>widespread search and rescue operation was put in place to find him.<br>His concerned family and friends reached out to the online community to help locate him in the hopes of reuniting with their loved one.</p><p>“Please help us find our brother and best friend, John Mugo, RN. John Mugo is a Travel RN. He had just started an assignment in a New York Hospital. Unfortunately, we don’t know what travel agency he was with to the hospital he was posted in.

Mugo. Our thoughts and prayers to his Family at this very difficult time.”<br>He also expressed gratitude to the community for their prayers, concern, and support.
