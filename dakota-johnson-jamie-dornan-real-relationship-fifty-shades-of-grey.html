Now that a couple of years have gone by since the last film in the Fifty Shades trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed, premiered, it's easier to look at the actors and get a clearer sense of their real relationship.</p><p>Cast to play innocent but sexy Anastasia Steele and kinky Christian Grey, the characters at the heart of the Fifty Shades of Grey novel by E. L. James, Dakota and Jamie had to fight tabloids and Hollywood press to prove that they were just two very good actors doing their jobs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dakota Johnson Admitted That Promoting 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' Alongside Jamie Dornan Was Hard</a></span></p><p>From the way they made each other laugh constantly, to their deep, trusting bond, all the way to whether the two are even friends following their on-screen time together, here are some facts about Jamie and Dakota's real relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan first teamed up to play Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey in the 2015 flick, Fifty Shades Of Grey. The two worked alongside each other for the two following films, which sparked a lot of rumors regarding their on and off-screen relationship. Despite being linked romantically, Jamie Dornan is a happily married man!</p><p>Dakota and Jamie had to share some rather steamy scenes, however after prepping for it in ways that made the situation the most comfortable, the two managed to keep things professional, all while developing an off-screen friendship unlike any other. While the two haven't seen each other since 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dakota and Jamie reunited</a> at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado in 2021, where they posed for a few pics, proving that they are still very close friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-dakota-johnson-and-jamie-dornan-not-like-each-other><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Did Dakota Johnson And Jamie Dornan Not Like Each Other?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-19.jpg><p>Despite its sexy subject matter, or maybe because of it, Fifty Shades of Grey was, initially, not an easy movie to promote for Jamie and Dakota.
