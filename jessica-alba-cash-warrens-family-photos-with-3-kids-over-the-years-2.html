The couple have welcomed three little ones since <a href=#>their May 2008 wedding</a>.</p><p>The pair’s eldest daughter, Honor, arrived one month after their nuptials, followed by Haven in August 2011. The actress <a href=#>gave birth to son Hayes</a> in December 2017.</p><p>The California native called baby No. 3 “the best gift to ring in the New Year” in an Instagram post the following month, writing, “Cash and I feel so blessed. Haven and Honor are already obsessed with their new baby bro.”</p><p>In a post of his own, Warren gushed, “You showed up a few days early, but we couldn’t be any happier. Your Mamma is the strongest woman I know … you’re so lucky to have her by your side. You have two amazing sisters who already adore you and I know you’ll be thankful to have them guide the way. On your first day of life, I promise to love you, to cherish you and to provide you with a sandbox full of dreams to explore. Welcome to the family my sweet baby Hayes!”</p><p>Two years later, Alba told<a href=#><strong> Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> that she<a href=#> considers Hayes to be her “cutest” child.</a></p><p>“Honor is not as good with Hayes as Haven,” the Fantastic Four star went on to say during the May 2019 <a href=#>Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> appearance. “[Haven] literally has an American Girl doll on one hip and Hayes on the other hip. She basically was complaining of sciatic pain [and] it’s because she holds this heavy baby. He’s, like, half her size.”</p><p>The L.A.’s Finest alum went on to say that Hayes is more “into” his dad than his mom and sisters, explaining, “It doesn’t even make sense. Cash will walk in [from] the other side of the house [and Hayes] will just hear the door open … and he’ll just be like, ‘Dada!’ from his high chair. Like, ‘Please get me out of this chair [away] from all these women.’ All of us are just crowding around him and squeezing him and touching him and kissing him.”</p><p>When it comes to disciplining the little ones, <a href=#>Alba relies on spy cameras</a> all around her Los Angeles home.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I can see [whether] they [are] messing around or … focusing [while doing virtual learning],” the Honest Company creator told<a href=#><strong> Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in January 2021. “I can call them out. I’m the voice from the ceiling coming in.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Alba and Warren’s best moments with Honor, Haven and Hayes, from family vacations to holiday celebrations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0qKammWRoa%2BiecKaqqFlp5a%2Fs7HNrGSfmZ2eubp5z6GmraejYsSqwMdmamajmZnAbrvVnqlmrJiaerqxwKuqZmpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
