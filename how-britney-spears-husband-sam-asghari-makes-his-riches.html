The singer previously said her conservatorship was preventing them from getting married. So, the couple wasted no time making their long-time union official the year after the decade-long conservatorship was released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they’ve been together for years, there’s not a lot known about Sam, which has made a strong portion of Britney’s fan base suspicious of her new husband. There have been <a href=#>accusations that Sam is mainly with Britney for her fame</a> and fortune as well as to boost his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Britney Spears Must Pay More Child Support If Her Sons Move To Hawaii</a></span></p><p>However, the couple has denied the rumors, with Sam candidly <a href=#>admitting they were planning a prenup</a> prior to their marriage. <a href=#>Sam currently has a net worth of $5 million</a>, which pales in comparison’s to <a href=#>Britney’s $60 million reported wealth</a>.</p><p>But there’s a lot of curiosity over how Sam has amassed his own fortune, especially since he wasn’t well-known before he was first linked to Britney. Here’s everything we know about how Sam Asghari makes money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-used-to-employ-sam-as-a-chef>Britney Used To Employ Sam As A Chef</h2><p>For a time, Sam was on Britney’s payroll. According to reports, she used to employ him as her personal chef.</p><p>“Britney told a friend that she used to pay Sam a salary as her chef but she doesn’t employ him anymore,” <a href=#>an insider told The Sun</a>.</p><p>It’s unclear how long he worked for her and how much he made, but past court documents from her conservator case showed that <a href=#>Britney has spent $500 a day for a personal chef</a>, so Sam may have made a similar wage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>The Britney Garage: Inside Britney Spears' Massive Car Collection</a></span></p><p>The same insider insisted that Britney and Sam’s relationship has never been about money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Some fans have this impression that Sam is in it for the money but Britney said it is not like that at all,” they explained. “She sees Sam as the one and is incredibly proud of how far his come since he first came to America as an immigrant from Iran."</p><p>"Britney rejected any claim that Sam is just another contract she has got herself into or taking advantage of her to cash checks, despite having worked for her before,” they continued.</p><h2 id=sam-earns-big-as-a-model-amp-personal-trainer>Sam&nbsp;Earns Big As A Model & Personal Trainer</h2><p>Sam is a man of many trades, and that’s evidenced by the fact that he’s had many sorts of job, which contributes to his net worth. He’s described himself as a dancer, model, fitness, trainer, and actor.</p><p>When he met Britney in 2016, Sam was working as a background dancer on her music video set for “Slumber.”</p><p>Since then, he’s leaned heavily into his work as a personal trainer. In 2020, he launched Asghari Fitness, an online platform offering custom training programs. The <a href=#>cheapest plan starts at $9 per week,</a> which can work out to nearly $500 per client if they train with Sam for a full year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam’s social following has grown immensely since his relationship with Britney put him in the spotlight. He currently has 3 million Instagram followers, which has undoubtedly helped him expand his fitness company.</p><p>Moreover, Sam’s online platforms allow him to make sponsored posts. Many influencers with over 1 million followers <a href=#>make at least $10,000 per post</a> if it’s a brand collaboration.</p><p>Additionally, Sam has had a variety of modeling gigs. He’s appeared in magazines like Health, Iron Man, and GQ, and each stint has likely brought in a decent chunk of change.</p><h2 id=sam-is-working-on-his-acting-career>Sam Is Working On His Acting Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam has also been focusing on another career path in recent years – acting. He’s married a variety of appearances in movies and films, including a multi-arc storyline in season 3 of Black Monday as well as the 2021’ thriller Hot Seat alongside Mel Gibson and Kevin Dillon.</p><p>Most recently, in November, it was revealed that <a href=#>Sam was joining the cast of Lioness</a>, a Paramount+ show following a group of CIA agents. Sam is set to play a side character, Kamal, who has been described as an “unapologetic womanizer.”</p><p>In 2021, <a href=#>Sam told Forbes he hopes to see his acting career</a> grow in the coming years. "My priorities in life are to remain humble and understand where I came from and where I'm going," Sam said. "I want to take my career to the next step when it comes to acting.”</p><p>However, fans of Britney and Sam’s relationship don’t have to fear. The fitness guru made it clear that, as much as he wants to focus on growing his acting portfolio, Sam is also looking forward to starting a family with his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I want to take my relationship to the next step, as well. I don't mind becoming a father. I want to be a young dad,” he said in the same interview.</p><p>If one thing is for sure, it’s that Sam has big things planned for his future, both professionally and otherwise.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Britney Spears Loses Millions Selling Mansion 9 Months After Buying</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>, <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>Style Caster</a>, <a href=#>Shopify</a>, <a href=#>Forbes</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMm6mirJ6axm6%2Fz56Yq6tdncK0rsCnm2arkaJ6or%2FGoZiroV2irqyx0mafoqtdp7aktMSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
