The top choice was Emily Blunt, being that she was a rising star as well. She starred in films like Dan in Real Life and Sunshine Cleaning. She made a real impression when she earned an award nomination for her performances in The Young Victoria and The Devil Wears Prada. So what happened?</p><p>When Blunt signed a contract to appear in The Devil Wears Prada, she was required to appear in a movie of Fox's choosing. Blunt starred along Jack Black in Gulliver's Travels. This created scheduling conflicts for Blunt, causing her to drop the role of Black Widow. With her out of the picture, Marvel turned to Johansson. She later joined the Marvel Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Parade Magazine</a>, Scarlett Johansson remembered that she was “second choice” for the Black Widow role. She admitted that she appreciated the role more after being turned down for it.</p><p>“I was really excited to work with [director Jon Favreau],” she said. Johansson talked about her excitement when she got the call for the part. “The best call you can receive is after you are rejected for something and then you get it,” she said. “You appreciate it more. I’ve basically made a career out of being second choice.”</p><p>She continued: “Since a very young age, I’ve been rejected constantly. When people starting out ask me for advice, I always say to stay open-minded, because you never know.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Roles Scarlett Johansson Turned Down (And 10 She Was Rejected For)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Passing up the role of Black Widow was a missed opportunity for Blunt. Gulliver's Travels only garnered $237 million worldwide on a $112 million budget. But, she was glad she didn’t become an Avenger.</p><p>In 2012, Blunt told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>&nbsp;her personal view on female superheros. She said, “Usually the female parts in a superhero film feel thankless: She’s the pill girlfriend while the guys are whizzing around saving the world.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansoon Reveals What Made Her Fall For Colin Jost</a></span></p><p>According to an article published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, Blunt was given a second chance to join the Marvel Universe. She was offered the role of Peggy Carter in Captain America, which was given to Hayley Atwell.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blunt told Vulture</a> in 2014, “It was never the right time, really, and it just didn’t work out scheduling-wise with those two. It’s always a difficult thing to talk about, because it’s not fair to the actresses who ended up playing them, you know? It just wasn’t the right time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Black Widow is Johansson’s first solo movie to hit theaters.
