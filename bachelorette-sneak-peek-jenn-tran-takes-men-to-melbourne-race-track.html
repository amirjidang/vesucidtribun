If he can’t teach you guys to drive, nobody can,” Jenn quipped to the guys, introducing local driving pro <strong>Jesse</strong> (not to be confused with show host<strong> Jesse Palmer</strong>).</p><p class=p1>As the men tentatively suited up, Hakeem, 29, realized quickly that Aaron, also 29, had a leg up on the others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bachelorette-Sneak-Peek-Jenn-Tran.jpg><p class=p1>“We’re all on the same playing field beside Aaron [because he] <a href=#>knows how to drive stick</a> [shift],” Hakeem says. “So, that’s a little competition there.”</p><p class=p1>Each man had a chance to drive in a car — which, naturally, featured a rose painted on the side — with Jesse for a chance to impress Jenn.</p><p class=p1>“I might have knocked over a few cones,” Jeremy, 29, quips in a confessional. “But, I’m doing decently well.”</p><p class=p1>At the end of the competition, the man who performs the best will win a coveted solo date later that evening.</p><p class=p1>Monday’s episode will also feature a larger group date for her suitors to showcase their stage abilities in local revue Thunder Down Under and a special one-on-one date for one lucky man.</p><p class=p1>Melbourne is the first international stop on Jenn’s journey to find a “ferocious love,” which she previously told <i>Us </i>ended up being unexpected.</p><p class=p1>“This season definitely breaks the mold in a lot of different ways,” she <a href=#>exclusively told </a><i><a href=#>Us</a> </i>earlier this month. “I never saw myself as the Bachelorette because, for me, the Bachelorette [is] someone who’s so confident, so poised, is articulate, can emotionally emote and can be vulnerable.

It’s about being able to just be yourself the best that you can, and that’s really what my whole journey is about — me being myself and embracing all of my flaws and everything that makes me unique.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>All in all, Jenn is “very happy” with how her <a href=#>season 21 of </a><i><a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> </i>played out.</p><p class=p1>“I can say that I definitely opened my heart up to a lot of different connections and explored a lot of these,” she told <i>Us</i>. “The way that things panned out throughout the journey and the way that things ended, I’m very happy about [it].”</p><p class=p1><i>The Bachelorette </i>airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWjo7Kit4ypnJ6jXZ%2Byr7qMramapl2prqyx0maknqZdqbxuucSlmaitoqOybr7AnJxmrKKWsKx7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
