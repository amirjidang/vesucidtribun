After his breakout performance as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network, Hollywood elites were clearly pushing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">him to become the new "it" guy.</a> Little did they know just how quickly their newfound star would fall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After an <a href=#>anonymous Instagram account began posting screenshots</a> of raunchy, embarrassing, and incredibly dark text messages allegedly from Armie, the dominos started to fall. His pattern of alleged behavior became more apparent through the information that came out. But things got so much worse for him in March 2021 when a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">woman named Effie Angelova came forward with abuse accusations</a>.</p><p>It was after this that Armie began stepping away from projects. His agency swiftly ended their contract with him, and within days Armie went from Hollywood's it guy to Hollywood's ick guy. So, how much money did the star lose during his fall from grace, and with all that has happened, is there room for the actor to make a comeback?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Armie Hammer's Career Over? The Scandal That Brought Him Down</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated July 2023:</strong> In February 2023, Armie gave his very first, exclusive interview to 'Air Mail'. In it, he acknowledged past wrongdoings but doubled down on his innocence. In May 2023, he was cleared of any sexual abuse charges brought against him.</p><p>However, his adultery ended his marriage to Elizabeth Chambers and the divorce between the two has been finalized. Rumors now swirl as to who Armie is dating, with everyone from former co-star, Alicia Vikander to ex-girlfriend Perejma being the tabloids' favorite names to throw around. But, according to Armie, he is prioritizing dating, choosing to focus on his mental health instead.</p><h2 id=what-is-armie-hammer-39-s-net-worth>What Is Armie Hammer's Net Worth?</h2><p>Before Armie fell from grace, the Call Me By Your Name actor had a net worth of $10 million. As of 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his net worth is estimated to be about $100,000</a>. Armie has denied any abuse allegations, claiming that his intimate encounters with women have always been consensual. While he was investigated for crimes against women, Armie was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> cleared of any sexual abuse charges in May 2023</a>. But it's safe to say his career certainly suffered quite a bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of the scandal, Armie was tied to numerous pending projects. He was scheduled to star opposite <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> in Amazon's Shotgun Wedding (a role later given to Josh Duhamel) and was slated for a starring role in the hit Paramount+ series The Offer. There were also talks about <a href=#>a sequel to the award-winning Call Me By Your Name</a>, but director Luca Guadagnino implied in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 interview he wanted to focus on other projects</a>. The timing of the announcement made many fans think the possible cancelation had everything to do with the allegations against Armie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-during-a-press-conference-for-hotel-mumbai-2019.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to the allegations surfacing, Armie was leading a lavish lifestyle. He lived in a $4.7 million mansion in the exclusive Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles with his now ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers and their two children. They sold the house in 2021 for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">less than the price they purchased it</a>.</p><p>That wasn't all, though. Things got so bad for the actor that he <a href=#>turned to selling timeshares</a> in the Cayman Islands for a period of time. He's thought to have since quit that job, but his net worth is nowhere near what it was before the scandal occurred.</p><h2 id=how-did-armie-hammer-39-s-family-respond-to-his-downfall>How Did Armie Hammer's Family Respond To His Downfall?</h2><p>In the wake of the scandal, fans immediately wanted to know how the actor's family felt about what was going on, especially his ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers, <a href=#>who had clearly moved on</a>. Taking to Instagram to respond, she shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was just as surprised to find out about what her ex-husband</a> was doing behind her back as the rest of the world. While the pair <a href=#>separated a year before the allegations surfaced</a>, they were married for ten years, meaning a majority of the alleged horrible behaviors were happening while the couple was married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-at-the-independent-spirit-awards-2018-1.jpg><p>"For weeks, I've been trying to process everything that has transpired. I am shocked, heartbroken, and devastated. Heartbreak aside, I am listening and will continue to listen and educate myself on these delicate matters. I didn't realize how much I didn't know. I support any victim of assault or abuse and urge anyone who has experienced this pain to seek the help she or he needs to heal," Elizabeth explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Could Armie Hammer Sue For Defamation After Losing Work Due To Assault Accusations?</a></span></p><p>She also said it would be the last time she comments on the matter publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear if Elizabeth knew about Armie's erratic behavior towards other women prior to their split, but the couple was in therapy together. The last straw for Elizabeth was when Armie left their family in the Cayman Islands during the earlier days of the pandemic. According to sources close to her, on top of leaving his family behind, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Armie also mistakenly sent an explicit text message to Elizabeth</a> that was intended for another woman the second he touched down in America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-at-the-on-the-basis-of-sex-press-conference-2018.jpg><p>Armie's aunt, Casey Hammer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was not at all surprised to hear about her nephew's erratic behavior.</a></p><p>"Based on my experiences in my family, I suffered from abuse," Casey explained. "It was just a way of life. You don't wake up one day and become a monster, it's learned behavior."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Casey also appears in the docuseries House Of Hammer, which dissects Armie's alleged dark behavior. Speaking with two of his ex-girlfriends, the documentary seeks to prove his darkest secrets to be true. One of his exes, Julia Morrison, shared that his really dark fantasy involving humans "was all he ever wanted to talk about."</p><p>Casey hates that the coverage of Armie has been diluted to focus on his alleged infatuation with what he likes to eat. "The focus seems to be about Armie, 'being a cannibal' or what was going to happen to his career, or 'cancel culture,' but it's like, wait a minute, let's shift the light onto the victims," she said to The Daily Beast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-armie-hammer-planning-a-hollywood-comeback>Is Armie Hammer Planning A Hollywood Comeback?</h2><p>Armie is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">desperate to get back into the good graces of the Hollywood elites</a>. He found little respite when going back to Los Angeles, however, with many of his peers shutting the door on him and eliminating him from their inner circles. One celebrity friend who didn't turn on Armie, though, is Robert Downey Jr., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who even let Armie stay at his LA home</a>. Radar Online also reported that Robert Downey Jr. paid for Armie's six-month rehab stay.</p><p>More recently, the disgraced actor was also seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having dinner with his The Man From U.N.C.L.E co-star</a>, Alicia Vikander, and two other people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-at-the-13th-annual-go-gala-2019.jpg><p>Since making his return to LA in 2022, sources close to Armie have confirmed that it's not a question of if Armie will attempt to make a comeback, but when. According to The Daily Mail, Armie never thought for a moment about giving up his career in acting. He simply wanted to ensure he got the help he needed before getting back into the scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Armie Hammer's Family Was Scandalous Decades Before His Career Was Ruined</a></span></p><p>In February 2023, Armie gave his first post-scandal interview. Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Mail</a>, he doubled down on his earlier assertions of all-round consent. However, he also acknowledged that there was a serious power imbalance between him and his accusers, and that he was aware he needed to take accountability.</p><p>According to numerous online sources, Hollywood film producers have been seeking out the actor for roles in small-budget films. However, at the time of writing, he still needs to find a new agent. Time will tell if the actor will ever fully find his way back into the public's good graces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6WZmnqprcymnKurXaOytXnWqKmtoF2jvLh5wJ%2BrnqpdqLCiusOao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
