A rep for the actor told the U.K.'s Daily Mail that Whishaw, 32, has happily been in a civil partnership with his partner, Australian composer Mark Bradshaw, for the past year.

British actor <strong>Ben Whishaw</strong>, perhaps best known Stateside for his portrayal of quirky Q in 2012's Bond film Skyfall, has come out as a gay man — and a married one at that.</p><p>A rep for the actor <a href=#>told the U.K.'s Daily Mail</a> that Whishaw, 32, has happily been in a civil partnership with his partner, Australian composer <strong>Mark Bradshaw</strong>, for the past year.</p><p>"Ben has never hidden his sexuality, but like many actors he prefers not to discuss his family or life outside of his work," his rep told the paper on Friday, Aug. 2. "Due to speculation, I can confirm that Ben and Mark entered into a civil partnership in August 2012. They were proud to do so and are very happy."</p><p>Fans of the acclaimed actor first raised questions about his sexuality after a 2011 interview with Out magazine, in which he skirted around a question about gay role models in the media.</p><p>"I really agree with that, and I feel in my heart that it's important, but I don't quite know yet the way to go about that," he told the publication of serving as a positive influence on young gay people.</p><p>"Maybe that's the transitional thing I feel I'm in the middle of at the moment," he continued at the time. "It's something I think about, but it's important for me to do it at the time that's right for me. And I'm not there yet."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Whishaw and Bradshaw, 30, first met on the 2009 set of Bright Star, a film about poet John Keats' love affair with his neighbor Fanny Brawne. Whishaw played the lead role, and Bradshaw composed the score for the Jane Campion-helmed project.</p><p>A friend of the couple told the Daily Mail that their family and friends are "delighted for them. Mark's a lovely guy, very talented and very close to Jane Campion. There hasn't been a chance for a big celebration because of Ben's schedule but I'm sure there will be one at some point."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZ5ixKm10qGYsGWTpLqmv4yorK1lkah6qK3YZqqksZaWua150q2Yq2Wdlr%2BztcSsZKaZoqB6o77Anaqhmadif3F9km5vaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
