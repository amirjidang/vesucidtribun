Dinklage attended the Delbarton School, where he developed and realized his potential in acting after starring in a play called <i>The Velveteen Rabbit </i>in fifth grade. Further, Dinklage started studying drama at Bennington College and graduated in 1991, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>.</p><p><a href=#>After graduating, Peter Dinklage moved to New York</a> with his batchmate from Bennington College and started a theater group inspired by Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Unfortunately, their idea failed, and the duo started working in Off-Broadway productions and started doing various odd jobs like cleaning pianos and answering phones to sustain themselves. It was difficult for Dinklage to find proper roles as an actor due to his short stature, which did not fit many roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About Peter Dinklage's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dinklage was strictly against getting typecast as a dwarf in loud and caricaturish roles, so he said no to various projects which required him to play such roles ignoring his financial condition.

He has acknowledged living on potato chips for dinner for years rather than taking on any demeaning project, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>.</p><h2 id=his-big-screen-debut>His&nbsp;Big-Screen Debut&nbsp;</h2><p>After years of struggle, Peter Dinklage made his big-screen debut in the 1995 parody movie <i>Living in Oblivion </i>alongside Steve Buscemi.

He received nominations for Best Actor at the Screen Actor Guild Awards and the Independent Spirit Award.</p><p>Even after all the success Dinklage obtained from <i>The Station Agent </i>did not open floodgates of offers for him.
