After a stellar performance, she booked a private flight to the lavish Hamptons in preparation for a private, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooney Island mermaid themed party.</a></p><p>The star studded shindig was held at the 13,000 square foot,&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amagansett mega mansion</a> of&nbsp;Galaxy Investment Partners' CEO,&nbsp;Mike Novogratz. Novogratz's former position as a&nbsp; hedge fund manager for the&nbsp;Fortress Investment Group landed him a spot on Forbes' billionaire list back in 2007. Though he's garnered a large chunk of his $7 billion wealth when he left Fortress and&nbsp;joined the&nbsp;<a href=#>crypto currency</a>&nbsp;industry with Galaxy. In 2017, he made $250 million through savvy investing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So it's no surprise that Novogratz could afford to fly in Cyrus for his massive ragger. Sporting a slim, red leotard with a four leaf clover belt and her signature blonde mullet, the star entertained party guests with some of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest hits</a> such as Wreaking Ball and, of course, Party in the USA.&nbsp;She also surprised the audience with a cover of Sinead O'Conner's&nbsp;Nothing Compares 2 U.</p><p>Cyrus wasn't the only star attending the party though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tons of notable celebs </a>were spotted at Novogratz's mansion that night:&nbsp;Steven Sachs, Bobby Shmurda,&nbsp;Samantha Cohen, and Sophia Cohen just to name a few. Hot dog eating champion&nbsp;Joey Chestnut even made an appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was certainly a party for the ages as there was no shortage of things to do. When guests arrived to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mermaid carnival decorated estate</a>, they walked through a box office entrance that had a neon sign spelling out "Novapark". From stilts walkers to mermaid performers, there were tons of fun to be had. There was even a food stall for all those hungry nautically dressed guests.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Entertainment Groups</a>' Price List, booking fees for pop stars like Taylor Swift and Pink usually range upwards of $2 million. So, it's safe to say that Novogratz paid Cyrus a pretty penny to make an appearance.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West's Donda Listening Party Breaks Apple Streaming Record</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ&nbsp;</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Guest of a Guest</a>, <a href=#>Page Six&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qrjEsmScsaKqwG68xKudqKqdqHqkvtipq6hlkp65rbXOp5iiqpVivbO11ZqrnmWSnr%2B1tMOasGaokafBuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
