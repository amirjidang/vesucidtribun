Easily one of the biggest pop music stars of the last five years, these days it often seems like everything Lipa touches turns to gold. As a result, she has a lot of devoted fans that know almost everything about <a href=#>Lipa‚Äôs rise to fame</a>. On top of that, <a href=#>Lipa has accumulated an impressive net worth</a> after cashing in on all of her musical success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, no matter how well Dua Lipa‚Äôs life has been going generally, that doesn‚Äôt mean that she hasn‚Äôt hit some stumbling blocks in recent years. For example, since Lipa has become such a big star, the world has come to know more about her personal life, and on at least one occasion that meant that she was tangentially linked to controversy. After all, Lipa‚Äôs most recent ex-boyfriend got himself in hot water with a lot of people when they were still together in late-2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Dua Lipa's Meteoric Rise, In 15 Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=dua-lipa-rsquo-s-dating-history>Dua Lipa‚Äôs Dating History</h2><p>During her time in the spotlight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa has been linked to several notable stars</a> according to whodatedwho.com. For example, in 2018, Lipa was rumored to be involved with the famous English actor, comedian, presenter, and writer Jack Whitehall. On top of that, the rumor mill claimed that Lipa was romantically linked to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin in 2019. While those two rumors are interesting, it is important to note that neither of those supposed relationships have been confirmed by anyone involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, some of the relationships that Dua Lipa has been involved in have been confirmed. For example, it is known that from 2015 until 2019, Lipa was in a relationship with Isaac Carew. For anyone who is unfamiliar with Carew, he is a British celebrity chef who was a model before he made food his career.</p><p>After breaking up with Isaac Carew in 2019, Dua Lipa began dating Anwar Hadid later that same year. Just like Carew, Anwar has made a good amount of money as a model during his life. Despite that, Anwar‚Äôs greatest claim to fame has been the ladies in his life. After all, on top of dating Lipa, Anwar‚Äôs mother Yolanda is famous for starring in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Then there is Anwar‚Äôs sisters, Gigi and Bella, both of whom are considered to be supermodels. After dating for roughly two years, Lipa and Anwar reportedly broke up in the last month of 2021. That said, when celebrities break up, there always is a decent chance they will get back together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Ladies Anwar Hadid Has Been Linked To, In Chronological Order</a></span></p><h2 id=anwar-hadid-lands-himself-in-hot-water>Anwar Hadid Lands Himself In Hot Water</h2><p>If there is one thing that every celebrity big and small should have learned by now it is this, social media can be a very dangerous thing. After all, there are far too many examples of celebrities getting themselves embroiled in controversy after posting the wrong thing on social media. In fact, when it comes to Anwar Hadid, he should have been especially aware of how toxic social media can be. After all, so <a href=#>many people have body-shamed Gigi Hadid</a> that fans came to her defense on Twitter.</p><p>Despite all of the reasons why he should have known to think first before hitting send, something Anwar Hadid posted in 2020 made a lot of people very angry. When a fan asked Anwar whether or not he was going to get the COVID-19 vaccination in late-2020, Dua Lipa‚Äôs boyfriend quickly responded ‚Äúabsolutely not‚Äù. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anwar explained that he would rather let his body fight off COVID-19 ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, in this day and age, it is controversial when any star takes a stance for or against the vaccine which is a shame. However, if a star really wants to make sure they outrage a huge portion of society, all they have to do is come across like they are flippant about the COVID-19 vaccine. Needless to say, it didn‚Äôt take long at all for Anwar to face a sizable backlash for his COVID-19 response and for that to splash back on his girlfriend at the time, Dua Lipa. As a result, it didn‚Äôt take long for Anwar to issue an apology and while he didn‚Äôt claim he was going to get the vaccine, he at least seemed like he was taking the subject seriously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ‚Äòanti-vax‚Äô I think everyone has to be careful with each vaccine individually looking at positive and possible negative effects. I have taken vaccines before but as someone who has had a compromised immune system, I want to continue to learn about the many ways I can protect myself and others. Never meant to offend anyone with my words, and I am so grateful for all the frontline workers and doctors and the powerful work they have done during this time. I'm listening and I'm all about the conversation, my response was not to make a stance it was honestly just a thought, but I can't expect you all 2 know where my heart and head is at and that's where I went wrong. I will be more aware. üòä‚Äù</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of this controversy, Anwar has also been accused of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posting various antisemitic comments</a> and has been called out for them by various Jewish groups. The same goes for comments made by Dua Lipa. However, both Dua Lipa and Anwar have maintained that nothing they've posted is antisemitic despite Jewish groups saying that they absolutely are. Regardless, it seems that Anwar just can't avoid controversy.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Rita Ora And Dua Lipa's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibrpldobaxrYybprKeop6yr7CMrKeloaRirq%2FDwKtkoZmUnrFur86nq6unppq%2FtMWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
