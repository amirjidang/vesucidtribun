The model, 19, and the rapper, 23, quietly split shortly before Baldwin checked into rehab for "emotional trauma," a source confirms to <strong>Us Weekly</strong>. However, one isn't necessarily the cause of the other.</p><p>"This was not the reason Ireland entered a multi-treatment facility," the source tells <strong>Us</strong> of the breakup. "She entered due to a variety of pressures in her life. Ireland is being pro-active, doing really well, and being positive about life."</p><p>Baldwin — the daughter of actors <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> and ex-wife <strong>Kim Basinger</strong> — was first linked with Haze back in May 2014, when she shared a photo of them kissing on Cinco de Mayo. Their relationship was later confirmed even more explicitly in The Independent's interview with the rapper, who has identified <a href=#>as agender</a> on Twitter and <a href=#>prefers</a> the gender-neutral pronoun "they."</p><p>"An interracial gay couple, I mean, that's just weird for America right now," Haze said at the time. "We f–k and friends don't f–k. I have never f–ked one of my friends."&nbsp;</p><p>The two made their <a href=#>red carpet debut</a> as a couple just a few months later in August, at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. More recently, though, Haze has been diving into work while hinting at personal troubles on Twitter.</p><p>been recording like a maniac. music is literally the only thing left ???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/W3ZEnjHd5V</a></p><p>— angxl hxze (@AngelHaze) <a href=#>April 13, 2015</a></p><p>this album is going to be incredible. redirecting my focus. i hope u guys love it. bcuz all the suffering hasnt hindered the creativity. x</p><p>— angxl hxze (@AngelHaze) <a href=#>April 13, 2015</a></p><p>Baldwin, for her part, is also active on Twitter, and has kept fans updated on her condition while in rehab.</p><p>I checked myself into Soba for two weeks to just get away for a little bit.
