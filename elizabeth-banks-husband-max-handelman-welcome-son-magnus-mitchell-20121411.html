The Pitch Perfect star and her husband of nine years, Max Handelman, welcomed their second child recently via surrogate, Banks announced on her website Nov. 14.
&#34;As 2012 winds down and Thanksgiving approaches, I have much for which to be thankful — personal, professional and Presidential,&#34; Banks, 38, writes. &#34;However, nothing can match the joy and excitement my husband and I felt when we recently welcomed our second baby boy, Magnus Mitchell Handelman."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"However, nothing can match the joy and excitement my husband and I felt when we recently welcomed our second baby boy, Magnus Mitchell Handelman. Magnus joins older brother Felix, thus commencing a decade or more of close hand-to-hand combat."</p><p>"Like Felix, Magnus was born via gestational surrogate," the actress continues. (Felix, 20 months, was born in March 2011.) "This experience has exceeded all expectations, taught us a great deal about generosity and gratitude, and established a relationship that will last a lifetime."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now, "I . . . turn my attention to managing two boys under two," Banks says. "For which I am thankful. And all their poop. For which I am less thankful. Wish me luck."</p><p>Earlier this year, the Hunger Games scene-stealer <a href=#>opened up to Lucky magazine</a> about her family's ongoing relationship with the surrogate who carried Felix — and why they chose surrogacy in the first place.</p><p>"It was a womb issue for me. Embryos wouldn't implant," Banks explained. "It's a big leap, inviting this person into your life to do this amazing, important thing for you. And it's hard losing that kind of control. But our surrogate is so extraordinary, and she's still in our lives. She's like an auntie."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepJmvrqOx06Fkm5meoMButNSsmZqmlGK6osSMoZinnJWhuqK6jLCcpZuforJuv86nZKaZl6PCtHnMoqucoJWhuW5%2Bj2ppamxhZnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
