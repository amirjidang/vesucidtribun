It all started a bit over a month ago, when Stephen Baldwin, Hailey's father, implied they were going through a rough patch and asked fans to pray for the couple. He posted a video of Justin Bieber singing "I Will Sing of Your Love Forever", and the caption was troubling.</p><p><strong>"Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw them closer to the Lord," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the caption read</a></strong>. "I seldom like to post about certain folks in the limelight because of the negative comments we get. Eileen and Hailey’s mom pray often together for J&H and our children as well. There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face and also the enemy doesn’t want them to draw closer to Jesus."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since then, the couple, and Hailey Bieber especially, have done their best to dispel the rumors. The model was reportedly upset by her father's words and their consequences and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement shortly after</a>.</p><p><strong>"Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong Made out of thin air... Come from the land of delusion..." she wrote</strong>. "So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qXZbBtbHNnapmm5%2BWsKmxy6WYZqiVp7OwvsyapZydXai8rbuMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZKGZmaGyunnBopybnaJiwLW%2B1KCepaGenHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
