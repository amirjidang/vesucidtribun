Speaking on movies that might not have aged well, Wedding Crashers appears to be next on the list. As highlighted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, two guys tricking women into sleeping with them&nbsp;via a string of elaborate lies probably makes for far more uncomfortable viewing than it did in 2005.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Michael Keaton Returning As Batman Might Work</a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, as was revealed by <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> during an interview with E! Online, Wedding Crashers is getting a sequel 15 years on from the release of the original. Well, more than 15 years by the time it sees that light of day as according to Ferrell, the movie is still in the process of being written. Ferrell joked about what a sequel to the movie could focus around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"How about if it’s just the lawyers representing everyone in divorce court? And just make it like a legal courtroom drama, not funny at all," Ferrell suggested. That would certainly avoid the elements of the first movie that haven't aged well. As for who is on board for the project, while there is no word yet on whether <a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a> and <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a> will reprise their roles, but it's hard to imagine the movie would be going ahead without them.</p><p>David Dobkin, the director of the first film, will return to direct the sequel. This comes after years of Warner Bros. nagging him to hop on board for a sequel. Dobkin revealed that the movie will focus on John and Jeremy who find themselves single again but in their late 40s. The idea of two men having to tackle that at that point in their lives and telling that story is what convinced him to finally agree to direct a sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine Scraps What It Had Taped For Season 8 And Will Start Over</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9aio6Vllpq%2Fs7HLpWSrnaaarq2%2FjLCcnZyZo7Rur9GaqqGdoqh6tLHQrpylZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
