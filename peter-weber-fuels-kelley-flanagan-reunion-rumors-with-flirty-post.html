After seeing a fan comment that he was “Having impure thoughts Ms Hottie!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥,” Weber responded simply, “Same.”</p><p>In that same comment thread, a second social media user wrote that she was “happy you guys found your way back together” <a href=#>after calling it quits in February 2021.</a> The pilot quietly “liked” the comment, implying that he and Flanagan may have <a href=#>reunited nearly one year after their messy split</a>. The Chicago native, for her part, did not react to any of the comments on her post.</p><p>Weber’s comments come weeks after Us Weekly confirmed that <a href=#>the former couple were spotted attending a Chicago Cubs baseball game</a> against the Washington Nationals on August 10.</p><p>The pair dated for nearly one year after his season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> finished airing in March 2020. Though Weber initially sent Flanagan home ahead of hometown dates — ultimately proposing to <a href=#><strong>Hannah Ann Sluss</strong></a> during the finale and ending their engagement because <a href=#>he still had feelings for runner-up</a> <a href=#><strong>Madison Prewett</strong></a> — they reconnected post-show.</p><p>“To be completely honest, I think just the nature of [<a href=#>The Bachelor] definitely works and I’ve said that since day one</a>. I still believe it works, but I think specifically for the type of relationship between, you know, Kelley and myself <a href=#>[it] just wasn’t the most organic type of situation for us</a> if it was going to actually work,” he explained to a fan in a Cameo video in May 2020. “What’s meant for you and what’s yours will always be yours, and nothing can ever change that. … That’s kind of always been our relationship. We’ve kept coming back in each other’s lives.”</p><p>After several months together, the couple announced on New Year’s Eve in December 2020 that they called it quits. Despite briefly reconciling the next month, <a href=#>Weber and Flanagan broke up for good in February 2021</a>.</p><p>“You come off [the show] and you’re like, ‘Oh, some of your hobbies don’t align with mine.’ It’s not a bad thing, [but] he loves Pokémon cards and <a href=#>he loves playing video games and he loves going out and partying</a>,” the former Bachelor contestant said during an appearance on the “Chicks in the Office” podcast in May 2021. “There was a while where I was trying to convince myself that that’s what I liked and I was like, ‘Alright, Kelley, let’s be honest with yourself. Does that add up for you?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Weber responded to his ex-girlfriend’s remarks</a> on his own podcast, “Bachelors in the City,” explaining that they liked and valued “different” things. “I will never apologize for liking Pokémon cards. … Maybe she was just playing along to make me happy.”</p><p>One year later, Flanagan hinted that she didn’t see the Virginia native as marriage material. “Peter and I had a lot of fun, but I don’t know if I looked up to him in the way that I wanted to look up to my spouse,” she confessed during an appearance on the “Talking It Out” podcast in May. “<a href=#>With Peter, it was just fun and games</a>. I could have fun with him, but I wanted more of a man that I look up to. I just didn’t look up to Peter in the way that I always hoped I would look up to my husband.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSav27DxJucq2WWqrKtv4yknKWkla56p7jAp5igmZ5iv6bBzaKmp2WiqrqwvtJmrqKsmGKzrbXRrbBmqJ%2BowXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
