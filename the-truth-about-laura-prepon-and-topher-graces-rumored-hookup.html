Allowing Donna and Eric's romance to naturally unfold gave an opportunity for Topher Grace and Laura Prepon to spend a lot of time on and off-screen getting to know one another. During the early days of filming That '70s Show, the duo's chemistry may have transcended <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">off the pages of script.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the filming of the first season of That '70s Show, the two actors may have spent some time together and brought some romance into the then-current Nineties timeline.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Celebs Inside, the duo was "Rumored to have hooked up in 1998."

Despite the fact the cast had no idea what the future would hold when they began filming the series back in 1998, creating a familial sense of friendship was high on their priority list. When reflecting on having a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lasting sense of friendship</a> with his castmates, Topher Grace <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> "Few people say they owe everything to one small group, but in my case it's true..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The theme of keeping up a beautiful friendship ran deep with Grace and his on-screen love interest Laura Prepon. As it turns out, Grace and Prepon's on-screen romance did not translate into real life. Any possibility of the duo ever becoming more than friends may have fizzled out over several kisses, and not in the way we would expect!</p><p>Locking lips on-screen over a long period of time may have influenced any kind of potential chemistry. According to Laura, herself, her friend Topher's kissing skills <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">did not rank very highly</a> among the spiciest of her on-screen lip-locking moments; Prepon put her future <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange Is The New Black</a>&nbsp;love interest Taylor Schilling ahead of her long-time TV love.</p><p>As it turns out, any possibility of a real-life romance between Prepon and Grace never evolved past their place in the rumor mill!
