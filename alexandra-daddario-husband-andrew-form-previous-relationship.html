After falling for Form, Daddario seemed very happy when she tied the knot with him in 2022.Before Form and Daddario walked down the aisle, he was previously married to Jordana Brewster. Based on what Daddario and Brewster have said about their relationships with Form, it seems like his two marriages have little in common.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-andrew-form-and-jordana-brewster-get-divorced>Why Did Andrew Form And Jordana Brewster Get Divorced?</h2><p>Ever since 2001, there have been a lot of fans who've known Jordana Brewster as one of the Fast and Furious franchise's stars.

I didn’t look closely at my career, my marriage."</p><p>Unfortunately for Brewster and Form, one of the truths about her life that she was distracted from was that she and her husband didn't have a true partnership. "But early in our marriage, my husband and I started leading parallel lives."</p><p>Once Brewster began to focus on her life instead of her weight, she realized that her marriage was fundamentally flawed and that resulted in her divorce.</p><p>"I realized something was missing for both of us. When there wasn’t a project to invest in together, we didn’t have much to say to each other."</p><p>"Once I slowed down and got quiet, I could hear myself saying, “We are not on the same page. I can either remain in this comfortable zone and distract myself, or I can face what is not working in my life and fix it.” I chose the latter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Knowing that Brewster and Form's relationship didn't work because they lacked a connection, that makes you wonder if his new marriage has a similar dynamic.</p><h2 id=what-makes-alexandra-daddario-and-andrew-form-s-marriage-so-different>What Makes Alexandra Daddario And Andrew Form's Marriage So Different?</h2><p>Thanks to the tabloids, social media, and the fact that stars take part in more interviews than ever before, a lot of fans feel like they understand their favorite stars.
