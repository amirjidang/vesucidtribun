Don't be stupid, I'm not gonna enjoy it. It's gonna be horrible!</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>“I got up, I barely had breakfast, I didn't have lunch. I genuinely think if I didn't win on that Sunday I still wouldn't be over it. It took me a while to get over Oakmont, but this was a whole bigger deal than Oakmont. The first tee on Sunday was probably one of the hardest places I've ever been.”</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Lowry’s nerves were heightened as he struggled on Portrush’s opening hole. As he readied himself for a seven-foot bogey putt, his nearest rival, Tommy Fleetwood, had a presentable birdie chance.</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>“If Tommy holes that and I miss, all of a sudden I'm one ahead,” said Lowry. “Fifteen minutes earlier I was four ahead.</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>“And Tommy missed his putt and I holed mine. I lost a shot but I went to the tee feeling like I'd gained a shot.”</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Lowry’s lead was never less than three thereafter and he was finally able to start enjoying the moment after birdieing the 15th to move six clear with three to play.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEqKeepl6YvK57y5qrnqukZMCprc2eZKWnp6fGbq%2FHq6anoZOhsrR5wqGYpqiZpLtus86lnZ6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
