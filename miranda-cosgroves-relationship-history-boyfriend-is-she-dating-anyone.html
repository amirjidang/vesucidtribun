While some of the world's biggest starlets have their relationships on display (for better or for worse), others keep things under wraps. This includes the likes of Euphoria star <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney and her boyfriend</a> and even Hannah Montana and Pretty Smart star <a href=#>Emily Osment and her relationship history</a>. While this may be a smart way of keeping the press off one back and maintaining privacy, it also gets fans incredibly curious. And it's this feeling that Miranda Cosgrove has had to deal with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though many have wondered <a href=#>what happened to Miranda Cosgrove after iCarly</a>, others have been desperately trying to figure out what's been going on in her dating life. After all, Miranda is an undeniably attractive, talented, and once extremely popular Nickelodeon star and child actor. So, of course, she'd be a magnet to any suitor. Not to mention the media's interest in starlet's love lives. But Miranda has been secretive. Therefore, there's only so much we know about who she has dated and if she currently has a boyfriend. Here's what we know...</p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-miranda-cosgrove-39-s-relationship-history>The Beginning Of Miranda Cosgrove's Relationship History</h2><p>In 2007, at the very beginning of iCarly's run, Miranda was reportedly dating Big Time Rush star, James Maslow. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Elite Daily</a>, the couple was spotted together at a few major industry events. Whatever went on between them was brief, however, as their fling was apparently over by 2008. Still, the two have been spotted together in years since but in a platonic way. So, whatever did go on between them clearly didn't end too badly. But the fact that the press knew so little about Miranda and James Maslow's relationship was the first sign that this was a star who didn't want all of her romance on display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Jennette McCurdy's Private Dating Life</a></span></p><p>Immediately following her split with James Maslow, Miranda was involved in her first long-term relationship. And to this day, it's been the one that we know the most about. And that's her relationship with Nat Wolff. Yes, Miranda decided to keep it in the Nickelodeon family by dating the star of The Naked Brothers Band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that the future Paper Towns and Joe Exotic star was also on the same network as Miranda, it wasn't entirely strange that they were spotted at the same events. But come 2010 when the two were seen leaving a concert together, fans started to catch wind that some love might have been in the air. However, according to Just Jared, Miranda publicly denied that anything happened between them. But this didn't quell the dating rumors. Especially since she told Seventeen in 2011 that she had just broken up with the only serious boyfriend she'd ever had. Up until that point, Miranda was really only spotted with Nat on a consistent basis and the two definitely appeared to have had some chemistry.</p><p>"I've only had one serious boyfriend, but we dated for three years. We broke up not that long ago. He's the one guy I really, really liked. People say they have that one person they never forget — I feel like that. Even though we don't talk too much anymore, he'll be the one who got away," Miranda told Seventeen in 2011 without mentioning Nat by name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Grace Van Patten And Nat Wolff’s Touching Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=miranda-also-dated-demi-lovato-39-s-ex-and-noah-centineo>Miranda Also Dated Demi Lovato's Ex And Noah Centineo</h2><p>Following her alleged split from Nat Wolff, Miranda was also rumored to have been with two other stars. One being Demi Lovato's controversial ex-boyfriend, Max Ehrich and the other, the star of To All The Boys I've Loved. Of course, like the boyfriends prior, Miranda has denied (or simply not conformed) being with them. This really seems to be part of her M.O. in order to keep her personal life private. Still, numerous outlets claim that there's enough evidence to say that Miranda was involved with these two men.</p><p>Miranda's alleged fling with Max Ehrich happened well before he was tied to Demi. Actually, it happened after he guest-starred on an episode of iCarly. Even though the pair were spotted hanging out in 2012, Miranda claimed that the two were "just friends".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Noah Centineo, Miranda would have a harder time denying that anything happened. After all, the two were spotted a couple of times out on dates around town. This includes the time they went to a Lakers game together in 2013. Still, unlike a few of Noah's other romances, whatever happened between him and Miranda was mostly kept a secret.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Unfortunate Truth About Miranda Cosgrove’s Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=miranda-cosgrove-is-currently-dating>Miranda Cosgrove Is Currently Dating</h2><p>Well, technically we don't know if Miranda is dating one person or many. But we do know that she is absolutely out there dating. This is because she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said so herself during an interview</a> before the iCarly reboot in June 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the interview, Miranda said that her iCarly co-star (and real-life neighbor) Jerry Trainor has been very helpful whenever Miranda has a "bad dating" experience. This is something that the star claims to be dealing with a fair amount in real life. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why she is so secretive about her partners... She hasn't found the right one. Additionally, because she keeps everything so private, Miranda is able to date as many or as few people without being judged. Whatever her story is, we hope she finds exactly what she's looking for if that's what she wants.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Miranda Cosgrove Admits She Tried To Convince Jennette McCurdy To Join The ‘iCarly’ Reboot</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqqRo7GiecKoqqCqn6uytHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkoaGjqbyzxYybprKeop6yr7CMoqpmq5iaeqWt06KloGWRo8awusRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
