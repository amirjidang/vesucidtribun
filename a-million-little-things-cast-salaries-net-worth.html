As proof of it, <a href=#>the network's new dating show, The Celebrity Dating Game, has captivated many viewers</a>. However, there's another series that has enjoyed great popularity. Once A Million Little Things premiered, it became a massive hit for the network. The show's season 4 just dropped, and it was a bittersweet moment for most fans as Stephanie Szostak's exit was finally confirmed after its premiere. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Since last season, Szostak's departure from the series has been much speculated</a>. The actress faced obstacles traveling between the USA and Canada during the pandemic to shoot for the show. In the meantime, her character, Delilah Dixon, faced a similar problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pandemic was also an obstacle inside the reel world of A Million Little Things as she remained in France for most of season 3 to compromise for Szostak's filming issues. As the actress was also looking after her parents, her character too had her hands full with tending to her sick father, who later passed away from a stroke in the season 4 premiere. The storyline was clearly setting things up for a smooth exit for the character as Szostak returns to her home only to announce that she wanted to take all her children back to France where they could have a fresh start. Since then, fans have wanted to know more about the actors behind the characters. Here are the salaries of the cast of A Million Little Things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-the-cast-of-39-a-million-little-things-39-make>How Much Does the Cast of 'A Million Little Things' Make?</h2><p>The cast has had a pretty successful career.

Moreover, one of the most asked questions on the internet is: Did Danny leave the show? Fans love the tear-jerker show was it portrays some real, painful moments that everyone can relate to. The show's title itself is a nod to the famous saying, "Friendship isn't a big thing- it's a million little things." As the new season aired on the TV, viewers were impatient to know what the story holds in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Forgotten ABC Family Shows From The '90s And '00s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have been worried about the absence of Danny in the show and wondering if he would return to A Million Little Things. In the series, Danny played the son of Jon and Delilah and had been staying by his widow mother's side after Jon died of suicide. Delilah was not around the whole season 3 as she had traveled to Europe to care for her father, who was ill. However, she couldn't return to the sets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and got stuck there. Hence, the writers got a bit creative and changed the storyline to run the show.</p><h2 id=did-danny-leave-39-a-million-little-things-39-or-is-he-coming-back>Did Danny Leave 'A Million Little Things' Or Is He Coming Back?</h2><p>Season 4 premiere showed Delilah traveling to France to care for her father, and Danny left with her. Hence, fans were worried if Danny left the show forever. They were also concerned if some real-world problem kept him from playing his role in the drama series like Danny. Nonetheless, he is likely to come back as the creator, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DJ Nash, stated that he could not tell if Danny's coming back</a> as they're putting it up in the story. At least, this statement sounds promising to the fans so they can hope to see their favorite character back on the show real soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 'Umbrella Academy' Season 3 Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqWZobmqu81mo6KspKGybsDHoqWgq12YrrTAjKyYpZminrK0ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
