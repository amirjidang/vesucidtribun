It was just a really incredibly fun experience.”</p><p>The former teen idol has starred in countless iconic ‘90s films since then — including Casper, Now and Then, and The Addams Family — but there’s one she would jump to revisit if given the chance: 1998’s The Opposite of Sex.</p><p>“It was one of the indies I did that sort of led to me having an adult career and the movie’s so funny,” the Sleepy Hollow star — who filmed the 1998 rom-com when she was 17 years old — shared. “[Dedee] was so unique and fun to play, and I’d love to revisit that character and that world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Christina-Ricci-Looks-Back-on-Her-Iconic-Career-1.jpg><p>“I think that would be really incredible,” she continued, “and I think it’s timely.”</p><p>Though Ricci is staying tight-lipped on whether she’ll return for season 2 of Wednesday — “I don’t think there’s any official word yet [so] I can’t really say anything about anything” — she was more open about the third season of Yellowjackets.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel like what happened with Natalie at the end of season two has to be incredibly devastating for Misty,” Ricci said. (In <a href=#>the season 2 finale</a>, Ricci’s Misty accidentally injects <strong>Juliette Lewis</strong>‘ Natalie with phenobarbital, resulting in her shocking death.) “I think the question is, how [does] everybody deal with grief and trauma differently, and how does this character deal with it?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Christina-Ricci-Looks-Back-on-Her-Iconic-Career-3.jpg><p>Ricci makes it clear it’s futile to throw ideas around on where Misty’s story will go since ultimately, the decision is in the hands of the show’s writers. “It’s pointless for me to even try to plan or make decisions because they will decide how this character reacts to this,” she said. “Then I have to figure out as an actress how to make that work and ground it in reality and emotion.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Ricci — <a href=#>who recently appeared on</a> Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis — is looking forward to her next big project: Guns Up, which she filmed with <strong>Kevin James</strong> before the SAG-AFTRA strike began. “Kevin ended up being probably one of my favorite people to work with of all time,” she told Us. “It was really fun and there was a lot of action in it [so] I’m excited to see how that turns out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmowaq6wGapopuTnnqzsdWemKWrXay1qq%2FHZnBpq12btq25jKyfnpxdoby3sYytpmaqlau2tLXTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
