Many big-name housewives fetch a higher up-front per-season price, while <a href=#>some make as little as $6,500 per episode</a>.</p><p>Given that RHONJ has been on the air for so long, its leading ladies fetch a bit higher salary than the absolute minimum. But even a sizeable per-episode salary doesn't keep Teresa Giudice from ranking as <a href=#>one of the poorest housewives in the franchise</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-teresa-giudice-make-on-real-housewives>How Much Does Teresa Giudice Make On Real Housewives?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screen-shot-2019-11-13-at-4-03-33-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most fans know about Teresa's legal troubles and the 2015 prison sentence she served for fraud after filing for bankruptcy. Her bankruptcy paperwork had claimed somewhere around $11 million in debt at the time, but it's unclear whether that was accurate.</p><p>Following the court case regarding the bankruptcy, Teresa and her now ex-husband were in a lot of hot water. Not only did they both serve time behind bars, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they also had to pay the Internal Revenue Service and the New Jersey Department of the Treasury</a> back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Of Teresa Giudice's Wildest And Most Memorable Moments On RHONJ</a></span></p><p>It's unclear exactly how much money Giudice owed, or where she's at in terms of payback progress. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her earnings as of 2021 were around $62,000 per episode</a> or about $1.12 million per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier in her Bravo career, Teresa reportedly made about $1 million per season, which across the 12 seasons she appeared in between 2009 and 2022 should amount to a take-home pay of at least $12 million. Teresa has other earnings as well, from various deals, books, and more.</p><p>Yet Giudice apparently owed over $10 million to creditors in 2010, plus almost $200K in credit card and other debts. Even if Teresa hopped on a payment plan at that time, it would take her years (on her salary alone) to repay the money owed.</p><p>To date, Teresa's net worth doesn't seem to have recovered following the legal issues and payback amounts.</p><h2 id=teresa-giudice-might-be-the-poorest-real-housewife>Teresa Giudice Might Be The Poorest Real Housewife</h2><p>Teresa Giudice is said to be worth somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 in 2023, depending on the source. That means she ranks rather low on the richest housewives list.</p><p>In contrast, other housewives are worth multiple millions; Real Housewives of Atlanta's Kandi Burruss' net worth is around $35 million while Heather Dubrow of Real Housewives of Orange County is worth about $30 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Tamra Judge Ever Friends With Teresa Giudice Before Their Brutal Fight On Real Housewives Of Orange County?</a></span></p><p>Other housewives are worth far less, including Tamra Judge (sub-$1 million), Melissa Gorga (about $1.5 million), and Phaedra Parks (around $2M).</p><p>Teresa clearly isn't making millions these days—at least, not yet. It's possible she could continue to build up her net worth, especially if she's finished paying restitution payments at this point.</p><p>Teresa's case is somewhat similar to that of Jen Shah, whose own legal troubles seemingly tanked her net worth. Even with massive earnings, neither cast member was apparently satisfied with how much money they were making and turned to illegal financial moves to pad their pockets.</p><h2 id=jen-shah-may-take-over-as-the-poorest-housewive-post-trial>Jen Shah May Take Over As The Poorest Housewive Post-Trial</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jen-shah-confession-look.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teresa Giudice's financial troubles are very well-known, but what isn't yet clear is whether she might be bumped from the lowest-net-worth spot by a fellow housewife.</p><p>Viewers know about Jen Shah's legal troubles, which threatened to completely bankrupt the formerly rich reality show personality.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What We Know About Real Housewives' Jen Shah's Prison Term</a></span></p><p>Jen was said to be worth around $3 million pre-trial, thanks to not only the criminally-tied marketing company but also other businesses. Her earnings from RHOSLC also factored into her net worth.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jen may have been earning between $50K and $100K</a> during her time on the reality series, so the restitution she was required to pay (reportedly up to $9.5 million) was a hefty amount. That's not considering Shah's expenditures, which Women's Health Mag notes were significant; Shah admitted to spending $50K per month prior to her arrest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for both Teresa and Jen, however, Real Housewives doesn't seem to blacklist its cast members for their legal troubles. In fact, much of the show's material comes from that type of drama, even as cast members go to prison (and are later released).</p><p>Only time will tell whether Jen, Teresa, or any other lower-net-worth cast member can bump things up thanks to regular paychecks from Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnqqVqK5us8ium6KblWK7psCMsKarrJhivbC70Z6qrWWimq6teceorKydp56zpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
