But after the show ended in 2015, many fans were left wanting more from the dynamite comedic duo and wondered if their days as a pair were over. Since then, they've each been pretty busy with <a href=#>tremendously successful</a> solo endeavors, which could bode poorly for a reunion.&nbsp;We're taking a look at everything Jordan Peele and&nbsp;Keegan-Michael Key have been up to and how their friendship has changed since&nbsp;Key and Peele ended.</p><h2 id=they-re-not-sure-what-a-key-and-peele-reboot-could-look-like><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They're Not Sure What A 'Key and Peele' Reboot Could Look Like</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world is very different than it was during Key and Peele's heyday, just a few short years ago. Both are committed to challenging the status quo and speaking truth to power through their work, so they have said they would need to be very thoughtful and intentional about any potential reboot. Keegan-Michael Key explained: “If we came back to do the show again...sketches would have to be written about what the causes of systemic violence and racism are, as opposed to the people."</p><h2 id=jordan-peele-is-pretty-busy-with-family><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jordan Peele Is Pretty Busy With Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan Peele married <a href=#>fellow comedian Chelsea Peretti</a> in 2016 and&nbsp;in 2017 she gave birth to&nbsp;their son, Beaumont, so now Jordan Peele is in his biggest role yet - "Dad." The couple, who met on Twitter in 2013 through various comedy projects, is notoriously low-profile, though <a href=#>their tweets</a> chronicle the hilarious and relatable ups and downs of parenthood.</p><h2 id=keegan-michael-key-was-on-broadway><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Keegan-Michael Key Was On Broadway</span></h2><p>In 2017, Keegan-Michael Key (who is a classically trained actor, having earned his MFA from Penn State University) made his Broadway debut in a play by another comedy idol: Steve Martin. The play,&nbsp;Meteor Shower, also starred Amy Schumer, who garnered a Tony nomination for her role.</p><h2 id=they-ve-worked-together-since-key-and-peele-ended><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They've Worked Together Since 'Key And Peele' Ended</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele haven't stopped working&nbsp;together since their iconic sketch show ended. In fact, in 2016, they costarred in&nbsp;Keanu, a buddy comedy that begins with a stolen kitten and devolves into a world of gang members and drug cartels. Jordan Peele cowrote the screenplay with Alex Rubins.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Sinkhole: Jordan Peele's New Mystery Film Is Deeper Than You Think</a></span></p><h2 id=keegan-michael-key-is-in-friends-from-college><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Keegan-Michael Key Is In 'Friends From College'</span></h2><p>Keegan-Michael Key has taken a step back from the writers' room with the Netflix show&nbsp;Friends From College, where he stars as Ethan, a 40-something Harvard alumnus whose life in New York City is inextricably linked to his&nbsp;college friends'. Maybe the show could have utilized his writing skills, though - despite the all star cast, the show performed poorly and was canceled before its third season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jordan-peele-is-a-big-time-filmmaker><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jordan Peele Is A Big Time Filmmaker</span></h2><p>Jordan Peele has become a sensation in the horror film world, having written and directed the seminal horror flicks&nbsp;Get Out and&nbsp;Us, and he also produced the Spike Lee black comedy&nbsp;BlackKklansman.&nbsp;Key was in the audience when he received his first Oscar, and watched tearfully as his friend took home the honor. He later tweeted "Congrats to my partner in laughs @JordanPeele on his first Oscar. #oscarssopeele #VFOscars." Photos of the two&nbsp;at the event show them hugging like family.</p><h2 id=keegan-michael-key-hosts-brain-games-reboot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Keegan-Michael Key&nbsp;Hosts 'Brain Games' Reboot</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keegan-Michael Key has one of those enviable careers where he's really gotten to call the shots and do all of the things he's interested in. Besides sketch comedy and acting on Broadway, he's&nbsp;also hosting the National Geographic Channel's reboot of&nbsp;Brain Games, a show where celebrities compete in short form games and experiments.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truth About How Jordan Peele Came Up With 'Get Out'</a></span></p><h2 id=they-ve-done-voiceover-work-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They've Done Voiceover Work Together</span></h2><p>2016's&nbsp;animated kids' comedy&nbsp;Storks saw Key and Peele back together again...sort of. The actors and longtime comedy partners both provided voices - Keegan-Michael Key as a wolf named Alpha and Jordan Peele as Alpha's advisor, Beta. Behind-the-scenes footage shows they are up to their old antics together and are just as funny voicing characters as they are live onscreen. They also both joined the&nbsp;Toy Story franchise in&nbsp;Toy Story 4 as Ducky and Bunny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-both-named-one-of-time-s-100-most-influential-people><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Were Both&nbsp;Named One Of Time's '100 Most Influential People'</span></h2><p>In his nominating piece for Time's 100 Most Influential People feature, Judd Apatow praises the&nbsp;duo not only for their killer comedy chops but for the genuine respect and affection they have for each other. He explains that their love for one another is apparent whenever they work together and that witnessing their process is "something&nbsp;very special." Their subversive style and pitch-perfect satire&nbsp;is so unique, these two will undoubtedly be creative partners for life.</p><h2 id=they-ve-said-they-re-not-done-working-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They've&nbsp;Said They're Not Done Working Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the end of Key and Peele, Keegan-Michael Key had this to say: "It was just time for us to explore other things, <a href=#>together and apart</a>. I compare it to Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. We might make a movie and then do our own thing for three years and then come back and do another movie."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Think This Is One Of The Best Hollywood Duos Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinp2Xlrtuucicn5qdnGK4psWMmqWdZZqkv6WtzWannp2cmnq2vMOaq55ln6N6tbTEoqlmr5%2BnuKq6xmapnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
