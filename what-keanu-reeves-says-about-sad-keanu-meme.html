Their conversation covered a lot of topics, including the famous "Sad Keanu" meme that made the rounds online.</p><p>During the conversation, it became clear that Keanu Reeves is quite bemused by the meme and doesn't understand how a simple image of him eating a sandwich went viral and why everyone assumed he was sad.</p><p>Stephen Colbert showed the picture of Keanu looking dejected while eating a sandwich on a park bench that all fans have seen at least once.</p><p>"We're all familiar with this image.

Stephen asks, looking to clarify once and for all whether "Sad Keanu" has any base in reality.</p><p>"I was thinking.
