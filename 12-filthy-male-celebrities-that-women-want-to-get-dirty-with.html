When one thinks of Hollywood, images of beautiful and healthy people wearing the most expensive clothes usually comes to mind. However, just because a person has millions of dollars and a billion followers on Twitter, doesn't mean they aren't human. Who hasn't forgot to put on deodorant? Or feels too lazy to do the laundry (so you just end up wearing&nbsp;the same black undershirt)? How is anyone going to find out? In this day and age, people somehow have a way to find out how many weeks a celebrity has been wearing the same black underwear. Things are different for celebrities. Their every move is under a microscope. The media reports on everything from, who they are dating, to who they just broke up with. However, just because a celebrity doesn't wear deodorant, wears the same undershirt, or grows the "unemployed" beard, in no way makes them unattractive. In many cases, it's what makes them even more appealing. Here is a look at 12 filthy male celebrities that women want to get down and dirty with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-bradley-cooper>12)&nbsp;Bradley Cooper</h2><p><a title="Bradley Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> is charming, handsome and grows some awesome facial hair. He's considered one of the top leading men in Hollywood. He's received critical acclaim for his work. He's appeared in the Hangover Trilogy, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook. He's also considered one of the sexiest and most desirable men in Hollywood. People magazine has even named him the Sexiest Man Alive. They might also name him, The Smelliest Man Alive. Apparently, Bradley isn't a huge fan of wearing deodorant. He's just too busy to put it on.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-orlando-bloom>11)&nbsp;Orlando Bloom</h2><p><a title="Orlando Bloom Net Worth" href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> is well known for playing the role of Legolas from the Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit Trilogy. He's also appeared in The Pirates of The Caribbean. He's charming, dashing and could be considered to be a beautiful man. However, it seems that this heartthrob has a few bad habits. He tends to forget to shower and will often wear the same clothes for weeks without a wash. There is certainly nothing wrong with any of that, with the exception that it might have led to the end of his relationship with <a title="Miranda Kerr Net Worth" href=#>Miranda Kerr</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-russell-crowe>10)Russell Crowe</h2><p><a title="Russell Crowe Net Worth" href=#>Russell Crowe</a> is best known for his Academy Award winning performance as Roman General, Maximus Decimus Meridius in Gladiator, released in 2000. He's also appeared in many other films like, L.A Confidential, A Beautiful Mind and Noah. Apparently, Russell Crowe should also be nominated for Best Unpleasant Odor. That's a nice way of saying he stinks. No, not his acting ability. Regardless of his tendencies to not wear deodorant and that he looks like his shaves with his eyes closed, he is still one of the top leading and most desirable men in Hollywood.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-anderson-cooper>9)&nbsp;Anderson Cooper</h2><p><a title="Anderson Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Anderson Cooper</a> is a journalist best known as the host of Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN. He's one of the most prominent openly gay personalities in Hollywood. He's the son of socialite, writer and heiress, <a title="Gloria Vanderbilt Net Worth" href=#>Gloria Vanderbilt</a>. He's handsome, charming and when he looks at you, it’s like you're the only one he's reporting news to. He's also known for wearing the same jeans for a very long time and washes them very infrequently. He is just too busy to wash his jeans. It's easy to respect someone who sacrifices personal hygiene for reporting the news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-viggo-mortensen>8)&nbsp;Viggo Mortensen</h2><p><a title="Viggo Mortensen Net Worth" href=#>Viggo Mortensen</a> is a well known actor appearing in films, Carlito's Way, 28 Days and History of Violence. He is best known for his role as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Apparently, to really feel like Aragorn, he slept in the woods and didn't shower. As everyone knows, Aragorn has a distinctive smell which seems to be B.O. Apparently, Viggo was able to not only capture the true essence of the character, but also the true odor.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-colin-farrell>7)&nbsp;Colin Farrell</h2><p><a title="Colin Farrell Net Worth" href=#>Colin Farrell</a> likes to smoke, drink, swear, not shave and looks like he just rolled out of bed…if his bed was a dumpster. However, Colin Farrell makes no apologies for who he is or how he looks. He's appeared in films such as, Phone Booth, Seven Psychopaths and Dead Man Down. In particular, it looks as if he dips his hair into a bucket of grease every morning. He has greasy looking hair. Despite the hair, he pulls off the "rebel without a cause" look better than just about anyone, and some people find that simply irresistible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-johnny-depp>6)&nbsp;Johnny Depp</h2><p><a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a> is considered by many to be one of the finest and most talented actors in the history of Hollywood. He's starred in films such as, Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Donnie Brasco and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He's considered a sex symbol and was named Sexiest Man Alive twice, in 2003 and 2009. Apparently, being sexy does not require one to take very many showers or change clothes…for weeks. Despite his lack of showers, he remains one of the top stars in the world.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-matthew-mcconaughey>5)&nbsp;Matthew McConaughey</h2><p><a title="Matthew McConaughey Net Worth" href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a> is best known for his roles in True Detective, Dallas Buyers Club and Dazed and Confused. He won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in Dallas Buyers Club. Early in his career, he appeared in an number of romantic comedies, such as, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. Apparently, he's also known to not wear deodorant. He believes his natural aroma is what women want to smell. For any other guy, natural B.O is the number one way to lose a girl in 10 seconds…unless you're Matthew McConaughey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-zac-efron>4)&nbsp;Zac Efron</h2><p>Teenage girls all over the world shriek and faint at the sight of teen idol, Zac Efron. He had his big breakthrough after appearing in High School Musical. He's starred in films such as 17 Again, New Year's Eve and Neighbours. In his spare time, he likes to play basketball and avoid showering. Apparently, the teen sensation would rather use baby wipes after an intense workout rather than shower. Regardless, teenage girls still shriek and faint at the sight of Zac Efron.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-brad-pitt>3)&nbsp;Brad Pitt</h2><p>Not many people could make smelling like day-old eggs and a shaggy beard cool, but <a title="Brad Pitt Net Worth" href=#>Brad Pitt</a> manages to pull it off. Brad Pitt has appeared in films, Seven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Fight Club and Moneyball.&nbsp;He's done everything from comedy to science fiction. There is nothing he can't do…except for shower. Apparently, he's so caught up in his work that he just doesn't have time to shower. There seems to be a huge craze in Hollywood, where celebrities just use baby wipes instead of the traditional, soap and wash. Regardless, Brad Pitt has mastered the, "homeless man finally putting his life back together" look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-robert-pattinson>2)&nbsp;Robert Pattinson</h2><p><a title="Robert Pattinson Net Worth" href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> is well known for playing the role of Edward Cullen in the Twilight&nbsp; series. As most people know, vampires are sensitive to light. Rumors circulate that the handsome and charming, Robert Pattinson is sensitive to showers. People Magazine&nbsp; named him the Sexiest Man Alive on two occasions. He was in Forbes Magazine Celebrity 100 List and Time Magazine 100 Most Influential People In The World. He's clearly a very busy man and has to sacrifice something. He's been known to shower infrequently because of his hectic schedule. Apparently, he waits till he can no longer stand his own smell.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-leonardo-dicaprio>1)&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p><a title="Leonardo DiCaprio Net Worth" href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is a very well known actor who has appeared in a number of critically and commercially successful films. These include, Titanic, The Departed, Shutter Island and Wolf of Wall Street. He's received universal praise for his acting ability. He's also very well known for his commitment and devotion to the environment. He's been praised by several environmental groups for his work. He's so devoted that he owns an electric car, has solar panels in his house, only showers once every couple of weeks to conserve water and doesn't wear deodorant because it's unnatural. Now, that's commitment. However, many people find that very attractive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqal2btq3Ax7JkppmcmnqkscuemauhpJ6ytHnToZitZaekuqa6jLCYp6xdqbxus8StZJ2hoqnGbsPIrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
