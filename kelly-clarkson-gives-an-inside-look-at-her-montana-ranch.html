Kelly Clarkson and her family are quarantining at her ranch in Montana — and she gave fans an inside look at the cozy residence.
In an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show that aired on Friday, April 3, the 37-year-old American Idol alum did a tour of the efficiency cabin on her Montana ranch. She kicked off by starting with the entryway, which featured a wreath that she received as a Christmas gift from fellow The Voice judge Gwen Stefani."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She kicked off by starting with the entryway, which featured a wreath that she received as a Christmas <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> from fellow <a href=#>The Voice</a> judge <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.</p><p>“This is our cabin and it’s super cute and cozy,” Clarkson said, before pointing at different areas of the quaint home. “This is where <a href=#>[my kids] Remi and River</a> sleep on little bunks, there’s [where] <a href=#>me and [my husband] <strong>Brandon</strong> [<strong>Blackstock</strong>]</a> sleep and then there’s where Seth, our 13-year-old, sleeps. It can also be another bunk, but our 18-year-old [<strong>Savannah Blackstock</strong>] usually isn’t with us.”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s kinda cute! This is where we hang out,” the “Love So Soft” singer continued. She also panned over a poster of <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a> hanging in the kitchen, and she noted that the home is filled with “games and puzzles” to keep her children entertained.</p><p>One week prior, Clarkson <a href=#>gave a more in-depth look</a> at her Montana home on her daytime talk show. At the time, she explained <a href=#>why she and Brandon, 43, love visiting the ranch</a> when they get the chance.</p><p>“We officially bought our ranch, Vintage Valley, over a year-and-a-half ago. I just love being outdoors,” she explained on March 31. “Brandon and I love wide open spaces and coming to the ranch because, well, both of us grew up in the countryside, one. And two, we literally work almost seven days a week if not seven days a week. So, you know, when we have time off, we really like to check out and it’s nice to get into nature.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Clarkson continued, “As a society, we don’t do it enough. We’re always working constantly, so it’s nice to just come out here and sit by the stream and hear the water flowing and be around all the trees. I just love the sound of just nature and not cars and people on top of each other.”</p><p>Scroll down below to see photos of Clarkson’s Montana ranch!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa4y7JknKSRp7i0u81mnqKulah6orqMoqWsoZSaeq27zqRkmqxdnbKzecyopa2ZnpZ6s63NnJ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
