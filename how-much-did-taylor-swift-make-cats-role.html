But the production still had a star-studded cast, and it cost a massive amount of cash to produce. In fact,&nbsp;the film didn't even make a profit; instead, it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cost Universal Pictures over $70M</a>.</p><p>So just how much of that cash went into Taylor Swift's already deep pockets?</p><h2 id=how-much-did-taylor-swift-earn-for-cats>How Much Did Taylor Swift Earn For 'Cats'?</h2><p>Universal Pictures spent at least a few million dollars on talent for the film 'Cats,' and there were plenty of big names signed onto the project. From Jason Derulo&nbsp;and Idris Elba to Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, a range of talent was willing to don catsuits -- for the right price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources disagree on the exact amount Taylor earned for portraying Bombalurina, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some say it's about $3 million</a>. Others say her earnings totaled at least <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seven figures</a>, which could be anything from one million to nine million.</p><p>That sounds like fair compensation for what the cast had to go through to become cats, even though&nbsp;Swift&nbsp;didn't even act in every scene (body doubles FTW!).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile</a></span></p><p>After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift once elaborated</a> that she had to attend hours of "cat school," where the cast crawled around on the floor and hissed at each other.</p><h2 id=does-taylor-swift-regret-cats>Does Taylor Swift Regret 'Cats'?</h2><p>By the sound of it, there's no possible way for Taylor Swift to regret having been in 'Cats.' She even hung around 'cat school' more than she was required to, and she explained that it actually led to her helping pen the iconic song that the lead cat sings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she kept mum on the specifics of how the film turned out, she did say she was thrilled to have been part of it; the singing and dancing are nothing new, but the acting bit was.</p><p>Taylor said she was lucky to have had the opportunity to be in 'Cats,' especially because the film was able to expand on the original theatrical storyline. In fact, she's said she has "no complaints" and that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's not going</a> to "retroactively decide that it wasn't the best experience."</p><p>So not only was it worth the money, but it was also worth the embarrassment for the connections Taylor made and everything she learned on set.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Calling For Special Edition Of Cats The Movie To Be Released" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Calling For Special Edition Of Cats The Movie To Be Released</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapeq6typ5knJmkqHqzu8ueZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
