Since my race for governor ended, I fell into a depression that has led to alcohol abuse. I witnessed my father suffer from alcoholism and I know the damaging effects it can have when untreated. I also know that alcoholism is often a symptom of deeper struggles. I am committed to doing the personal work to heal fully and show up in the world as a more complete person.</p><p>“I now need to firmly focus on myself and my family,” continued the married father of three. “I will be stepping down from all public facing roles for the foreseeable future. I want to apologize to my family, friends and the people of Florida who have supported me and put their faith in me over the years.”</p><p>The announcement comes days after Gillum was said to be extremely intoxicated when police arrived to a room inside Miami’s Mondrian Hotel. Authorities were responding to a 911 call placed by another man,&nbsp;Aldo Mejias, who administered CPR to a third man, Travis Dyson, who reportedly overdosed. A substance was found in the room that was believed to be crystal meth. Gillum denied using drugs but explained that he was extremely drunk at the time of the incident and was in town for a wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7pb7EsGSgoZyhwq5506hknqakmr9uvsShmJtlkaGwsLTOpWSamqWosm6Clm9qcWxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
