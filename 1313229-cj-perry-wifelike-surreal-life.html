[Surreal Life]&nbsp;was by far the most insane thing I’ve ever done in my life, and the 13 days that I lived in that house seemed like 13 months.</p><p>“It was crazy. They took our phones as well, so that was slightly traumatic. Classic millennial, I’m like wow. But yeah, made it through and you’ll have to, it’s gonna be on MTV, and it’s gonna be on Paramount+. They haven’t released the date yet, but they’re saying the fall, end of the year.”</p><p>Perry spoke more about&nbsp;WifeLike&nbsp;and spoke about how science fiction and real life are starting to catch up with each other.</p><p>“Oh my god, it’s so crazy. It’s basically about creating AIs to be the perfect woman,” Perry explained, “so it really is really crazy, and knowing how — with all the artificial intelligence and robots and cars driving themselves and people wanting trucks to drive themselves — it’s like oh, this all a possibility in the future. I love science, and I love that we keep on advancing ourselves, we should. But I do think it’s important to be thinking about how can we set some parameters so we don’t end up in a ‘WifeLike’ situation.”</p><p>Check out the trailer for WifeLike below:</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: A grieving detective in the near-future (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) hunts down criminals who trade artificial humans on the black market. In the fight to end AI exploitation, an underground resistance attempts to infiltrate him by sabotaging the programming of the artificial human assigned as his companion (Elena Kampouris) to behave like his late wife. She begins to question her reality as memories of a past life begin to surface in a world where nothing is as it seems.</p><p>Featuring: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Elena Kampouris, Doron Bell, Agam Darshi, Sara Sampaio, Alix Villaret, Fletcher Donovan, CJ Perry, Stephen Lobo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJqamtqaWKwq3nPnqmrsV2stqexy6KinmWjqr%2BzscClZKWhlpo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
