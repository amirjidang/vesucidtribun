While there, the cops then discovered Travis Scott, who appeared to be allegedly arguing with someone aboard another yacht. The unnamed person then reported him to the cops, who then demanded that he leave the yacht.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Travis Scott allegedly wouldn’t leave the area after a fight broke out on a yacht, I’m told.</p><p>Cops also smelled alcohol coming from him.</p><p>Sources say Scott later admitted to drinking and told police “it’s Miami.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/4xpg7gntx0</a></p>— Andy Slater (@AndySlater) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 20, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the cops began escorting the “FE!N” rapper away from the premises, the authorities claimed that Scott began “yelling obscenities” at the people on the boat. The outlet reports that law enforcement took him to a vehicle waiting for the rapper, who then told the cops that if he got into the vehicle, the unnamed <a href=#>man was “gonna catch a fade.”</a> <a href=#>The Air Jordan ambassador </a>returned five minutes later and attempted to return back to the yacht. Law enforcement caught him, to which then Travis Scott grew enraged and “belligerent” and was promptly arrested.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Travis Scott had been scooped up by the authorities early Thursday morning at the Miami Beach Marina and booked at the county jail. Scott’s bond was set at $650 — on $150 for his public intoxication charges and then $500 for trespassing. Scott has since posted his bail and has already been released from jail.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After his <a href=# id=auto-tag_arrest data-tag=arrest>arrest</a>, the rapper sent a message on social media, typing a vague and simple response, which read, “Lol.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">VIBE has contacted a Travis Scott representative for a comment but hasn’t heard back yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-20-at-9.07.55-AM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m%2FosLIrGSsm5%2BpwW6t0aucrKyVmXqltdKoqZ2doqHGbq%2FOp5uum6RiwbOx0qmYrKuZo7RuuciapKJlYWeAdYSXcGxpcF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
