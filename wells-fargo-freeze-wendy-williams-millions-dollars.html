In the document, the television personality claims she’s been “denied any access” to her “financial accounts, assets, and statements” for the past two weeks.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Virgil Abloh-Designed Sneaker Collection Sells For $25 Million At Auction</a></span></p><p>She continues on in the letter to explain that Wells Fargo made the decision to deny her access based on the recommendation of her former financial advisor, Lori Schiller, who claimed Williams was of “unsound mind.”</p><p><a href=#>Williams</a> added that she has since fired Schiller due to her “malfeasance” with her financial account as well as “improper conduct” in reference to their professional relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wells Fargo has filed their own documents with the court, which explain they had reason to believe Williams was the “victim of undue influence and financial exploitation." But as PEOPLE notes, the bank declined to specify who or what is putting Williams in this position.</p><p>While Wells Fargo admits to making the decision based on the recommendation of Schiller, it adds that “other independent third parties” were consulted before coming to the conclusion.</p><p>Williams – who says she has “several million dollars” in her bank account&nbsp;– is asking for immediate access to her finances. However, should the freeze on her account and assets continue, Williams says she’ll have no choice but to “default” on a variety of bills, including her spousal support, employee salaries, and mortgages.</p><p>Legal representation for Wells Fargo has requested that a guardian be appointed to oversee Williams’ finances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a letter sent by Wells Fargo’s attorney, David H. Pikus, the bank referred to the celebrity as “incapacitated.” However, Williams’ representatives have adamantly denied the assertion.</p><p>Williams has had a variety of health issues recently, including Graves’ disease – an autoimmune disorder that causes damages to the thyroid gland. Symptoms of the condition can include bulging eyes, weight loss, and a quicker-than-usual metabolism.</p><p>The season thirteen premiere of The Wendy Williams show was delayed twice as a result of her health issues. It’s since been confirmed she won’t be returning to the show this season. In Williams’ place, a variety of celebrity guest hosts have appeared, including Leah Remini and Jerry Springer.</p><p>It's also currently being reported that Sheri Shepherd will be the permanent guest host until Williams is well enough to return.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Black Diamond With Unknown Origins Sells For $4.5 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>ET Canada</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTEprjLrGSfmaKcvG6y0Z6cs51drLKvsNhmrqKknJ6urr%2BMpqClpJmku7R5w6ijpZmiqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
